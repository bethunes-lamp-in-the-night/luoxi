```
SECOND-BY-SECOND SCRIPT:

0:00-0:03 | Visual: Grandmother photo, NO TEXT
          | Audio: Silent

```

### Text Overlays (Word-for-Word)

**Overlay 1 (0:03-0:05):**
```
2:05 AM
```

**Overlay 2 (0:05-0:10):**
```
Seven days after
```

**Overlay 3 (0:10-0:15):**
```
her granddaughter died
```

**Overlay 4 (0:15-0:18):**
```
#JusticeForLuoxi
```

**CRITICAL: Keep text minimal. The photo does the work. Over-explaining kills emotional impact.**

---

### Caption Template (Copy-Paste to TikTok)

**Option A (Emotional + Minimal):**
```
A grandmother feeds her granddaughter's empty clothes. Seven days after the baby died from a surgery the autopsy proved was unnecessary. #JusticeForLuoxi
```

**Option B (Context + Evidence):**
```
At 2:05 AM, seven days after her granddaughter died, a grandmother fed an empty bottle to the baby's folded clothes. The surgeon promised 99.5% success. The autopsy found no defect requiring surgery. #JusticeForLuoxi #RememberLuoxi
```

**Option C (Question Format—Higher Engagement):**
```
What does grief look like? A grandmother feeding an empty bottle to her granddaughter's clothes. 2:05 AM. Seven days after the baby died from unnecessary surgery. #JusticeForLuoxi
```

**RECOMMENDATION: Use Option A for first post. Test Option C if Video 1 gets <5K views (repost edited version Week 2).**

---

### Hashtags (Use 3-5 Total)

**Primary (MUST USE):**
- #JusticeForLuoxi (campaign tag, always include)
- #RememberLuoxi (memorial tag)

**Secondary (Pick 1-2):**
- #GriefHasNoWords (emotional niche)
- #MedicalMalpractice (discovery niche)
- #TruthMatters (justice niche)

**Trending Hijack (Pick 0-1, ONLY if relevant and trending on TikTok that day):**
- Check TikTok "Discover" page day-of-posting
- If health/parenting/justice tag is trending, add it
- Examples: #HealthcareReform, #ParentsOfTikTok, #SystemicChange

**Final Hashtag String (Example):**
```
#JusticeForLuoxi #RememberLuoxi #GriefHasNoWords
```

---

### Call-to-Action (CTA)

**In caption (if using Option B or C):**
- Already embedded: "The autopsy proved..." (implicit CTA: learn more, share)

**In pinned comment (post immediately after video goes live):**
```
The surgeon promised 99.5% success. The autopsy found the diagnosis was wrong. The hospital offered $1,400. The family said: "We don't want money. We want the truth." Share before this story is forgotten. Link in bio for full timeline.
```

**Alternative pinned comment (question format to boost engagement):**
```
What would you do if this happened to your family? Comment below. 👇
```

**RECOMMENDATION: Use evidence-based pinned comment (first option). TikTok algorithm prioritizes informational content over engagement bait in 2026.**

---

### Production Notes

**Why this video first:**
- Shortest production time (5-7 hours including CapCut learning curve)
- Single photo = no transitions, no complex editing
- Silent = no audio sync issues, no copyright worries
- Highest emotional impact = best chance at FYP algorithm push

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- ❌ Adding music (kills the haunting silence—resist temptation)
- ❌ Over-explaining in text ("This is a grandmother in China who lost her granddaughter to medical malpractice"—too wordy, kills emotional punch)
- ❌ Starting with context ("In China, there's a case..."—boring, people scroll immediately)
- ❌ Filters/effects on photo (keep it raw and real—documentary style)
- ❌ Text too small (must be readable on phone without zooming)

**If you get stuck on CapCut:**
- YouTube search: "CapCut text overlay tutorial 2026" (10-minute videos exist)
- Alternative: Upload photo to TikTok app, add text using native TikTok editor (easier but less control)

---

Visual: Transition to autopsy document (quick cut, no fade)
Text Overlay: "But here's what the autopsy found..."
Position: Center, larger font, different color (RED or YELLOW to signal shift)

### Caption Template (Copy-Paste to TikTok)

**Option A (Evidence-Led):**
```
A surgeon promised 99.5% success. The baby died. The autopsy revealed the diagnosis was wrong—no defect requiring surgery existed. Hospital closed its cardiac department. Family rejected $1,400 compensation: "We want the truth, not money." #JusticeForLuoxi #MedicalMalpractice
```

**Option B (Narrative Arc):**
```
5-month-old Luoxi went in for "routine" heart surgery. The surgeon promised 99.5% success. She died 6 hours later. The autopsy found: no defect requiring surgery, patch left inside, wound unsutured. 290K people following. Zero Western media. #JusticeForLuoxi
```

**Option C (Question Hook—Higher Engagement):**
```
What if hospitals were performing unnecessary surgeries for profit? This is Luoxi. The surgeon promised 99.5% success. The autopsy proved the diagnosis was false. Here's what happened next. #JusticeForLuoxi #TruthMatters
```

**RECOMMENDATION: Use Option B (narrative arc matches video structure). Test Option C if Video 2 underperforms.**

### Hashtags (Use 3-5 Total)

**Primary (MUST USE):**
- #JusticeForLuoxi
- #MedicalMalpractice

**Secondary (Pick 1-2):**
- #PatientRights
- #HospitalAccountability
- #TruthMatters

**Niche Discovery (Pick 0-1):**
- #MedTwitter (medical professional audience)
- #HealthcareReform (policy-focused audience)

**Final Hashtag String (Example):**
```
#JusticeForLuoxi #MedicalMalpractice #PatientRights #TruthMatters
```

---

### Call-to-Action (CTA)

**In caption:**
- Embedded in narrative (Option B: "290K following. Zero Western media"—implicit CTA to change that)

**Pinned comment (post immediately after upload):**
```
Full timeline:
- Nov 11: Baby admitted, all tests normal
- Nov 14: 6-hour surgery, baby dies
- Dec 11: Autopsy reveals no defect requiring surgery
- Dec 22: Hospital closes cardiac department
- Dec 23: Provincial government investigation
- Jan 2026: 290K followers, family still seeking justice

Sources in bio. Share before this story is forgotten.
```

**Alternative pinned comment (journalist targeting):**
```
Why isn't Western media covering this? 290,000 people in China are following this case. Hospital closed its cardiac surgery department. Provincial government investigating. Someone needs to tell this story. Tag a journalist. 📰
```

**RECOMMENDATION: Use timeline pinned comment (informational, boosts credibility). Second option good if Video 1 failed to attract journalists organically.**

---

### Production Notes

**Pattern interrupt execution:**
- 0:13 interrupt: Use quick cut (not fade) + color change on text (red/yellow) + optional music beat drop
- 0:30 interrupt: Emotional photo + text color shift (white on red bar funeral style)
- These interrupts are CRITICAL—they're what keep 60-second video from losing viewers at 15s and 30s

**Music recommendation:**
- Search TikTok Sound Library: "sad piano" or "emotional instrumental"
- Check if sound is trending (trending sounds get 20-30% more FYP push)
- Volume: 30-40% (background, not overpowering—text is primary)
- Alternative: Stay silent if Video 1 performed well silent (test what works)

**Photo sourcing:**
- Use real photos from evidence/photos/ directory
- Autopsy document: Translate key finding or use English text overlay (don't show graphic medical details)
- If baby before/after photos unavailable, use grandmother photo as emotional anchor throughout

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- ❌ All text on screen at once (overwhelming, people tune out)
- ❌ Text too fast (need 3-5 seconds per line for reading + processing)
- ❌ No pattern interrupts (video feels flat, retention drops at 15s and 30s)
- ❌ Music too loud (competes with reading text)
- ❌ Starting with backstory (hook must be immediate—"99.5% success" first frame)

---

### Expected Performance

**Conservative (60% probability):**
- 8K-20K views in 48 hours
- 300-800 likes
- 30-80 comments
- Completion rate: 55-65% (longer videos harder to complete, but pattern interrupts help)

**Target (30% probability):**
- 25K-60K views in 48 hours
- 1.5K-4K likes
- 100-250 comments
- Shares: 800-2K (evidence-based content gets shared for credibility)

**Optimistic (10% probability):**
- 100K-250K views in 48 hours
- 5K-15K likes
- 500-1.5K comments
- Medical professional engagement (doctors/nurses commenting, validating story)

**Success threshold: 15K+ views in 48 hours = evidence angle resonates, create more documentary-style content Week 2**

### Caption Template (Copy-Paste to TikTok)

**Option A (Memorial Focus):**
```
Remember Luoxi. 5 months old. November 2025. She died from a surgery the autopsy proved was unnecessary. 290,000 people won't let her story be forgotten. Say her name. #RememberLuoxi #JusticeForLuoxi
```

**Option B (Call-to-Action Focus):**
```
Her name was Luoxi. She was 5 months old. The surgeon promised success. The autopsy revealed the surgery was unnecessary. The hospital closed its cardiac department. Don't let her be forgotten. #RememberLuoxi
```

**Option C (Question Format):**
```
How many babies die from unnecessary procedures? This is Luoxi. 5 months old. The autopsy proved she didn't need surgery. 290K people remember her. Will you? #RememberLuoxi #SayHerName
```

**RECOMMENDATION: Use Option A (memorial focus aligns with video tone). Option C good if targeting activist/reform audience.**

---

### Hashtags (Use 3-5 Total)

**Primary (MUST USE):**
- #RememberLuoxi (campaign memorial tag)
- #JusticeForLuoxi

**Secondary (Pick 1-2):**
- #SayHerName (memorial movement language)
- #NeverForget (memorial community)
- #MedicalMalpractice (niche discovery)

**Emotional Niche (Pick 0-1):**
- #GoneButNotForgotten (memorial content community)
- #InMemory (memorial tag)

**Final Hashtag String (Example):**
```
#RememberLuoxi #JusticeForLuoxi #SayHerName
```

---

### Call-to-Action (CTA)

**In caption:**
- Embedded: "Say her name" (Option A) or "Don't let her be forgotten" (Option B)

**Pinned comment (post immediately after upload):**
```
Her name was Luoxi (珞夕).
Born: June 2025
Died: November 14, 2025
Cause: Heart surgery the autopsy proved was unnecessary

290,000 people in China are keeping her memory alive.
Share so the world remembers her too.

#RememberLuoxi
```

**Alternative pinned comment (community building):**
```
Comment "Remember Luoxi" if you won't let this story be forgotten. 👇

Every comment keeps her name visible. Every share spreads the truth.
```

**RECOMMENDATION: Use first option (informational pinned comment). Memorial content works better with substance than engagement bait.**

---

### Production Notes

**Music selection (CRITICAL for memorial tone):**
- Search TikTok Sound Library: "memorial piano" OR "sad acoustic guitar"
- Avoid: Overly dramatic orchestral (feels manipulative)
- Ideal: Simple, gentle, reflective (piano or acoustic)
- Volume: 40-50% (more prominent than Video 2, but doesn't overpower text)

**Photo selection:**
- Lead with happiest photo (life before tragedy creates emotional arc)
- End with same photo (circular structure—"Remember her THIS way, not the tragedy")
- Avoid: Graphic medical photos (memorial content should honor life, not display death)

**Text style:**
- Memorial font: Bold, clean, readable (avoid script/cursive fonts—hard to read on phone)
- Color scheme: White text with black or gray backgrounds (funeral/memorial visual language)
- Animation: Slow fades (NOT quick cuts—memorial pace is contemplative)

**Why this video third:**
- Builds on Videos 1-2 emotional foundation (viewers already know story)
- Memorial angle is lower friction (less confrontational than malpractice/censorship)
- #RememberLuoxi becomes searchable tag (campaign identity consolidation)
- If Videos 1-2 gained traction, Video 3 converts followers to community

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- ❌ Too much detail (memorial should be simple, not exhaustive—save detail for Video 2)
- ❌ Graphic imagery (defeats memorial purpose)
- ❌ Upbeat music (tonal mismatch—kills emotional resonance)
- ❌ "Justice" language too strong (memorial = reflection, not rage—rage is Video 1-2)
- ❌ Over-explaining (let the name repetition and "290K won't forget" speak)

---

### Expected Performance

**Conservative (60% probability):**
- 3K-10K views in 48 hours
- 150-400 likes
- 20-60 comments ("Rest in peace," "Remember Luoxi," etc.)
- Completion rate: 70-75% (30s memorial format has good retention)

**Target (30% probability):**
- 12K-35K views in 48 hours
- 600-2K likes
- 80-200 comments
- High save rate (memorial content gets saved/bookmarked more than other types)

**Optimistic (10% probability):**
- 50K-150K views in 48 hours (memorial angle hits broad emotional resonance)
- 3K-8K likes
- 300-800 comments ("Say her name" movement-style engagement)
- #RememberLuoxi becomes trending hashtag (community consolidation)

**Success threshold: 8K+ views in 48 hours + high comment quality (not just emojis, but "Remember Luoxi" text) = campaign identity established**

## FINAL NOTES

### What Success Looks Like Week 1

**Minimum Success (Continue to Week 2):**
- 20K-50K total views across 3 videos
- 1 video with 10K+ views (proves one angle works)
- 100-300 followers gained
- 0-1 journalist email responses

**Target Success (Month 1 on track):**
- 60K-150K total views across 3 videos
- 1-2 videos with 30K+ views each
- 500-1,500 followers gained
- 1-2 journalist email responses

**Breakthrough Success (Rare but possible):**
- 300K-700K total views (grandmother photo goes viral)
- Video 1 with 200K+ views, Videos 2-3 riding momentum
- 3K-8K followers gained
- 3-5 journalist organic inquiries (they found video, not email)

### If Week 1 Underperforms (<20K total views)

**Don't panic. Iterate:**
1. Watch videos again—were hooks too slow? Text too wordy? Photos unclear?
2. Test completely different formats Week 2:
   - Silent vs. voiceover vs. text-only
   - 15s vs. 30s vs. 60s length
   - Photo-only vs. mixed media
3. Check if niche wrong:
   - Maybe TikTok medical malpractice audience small?
   - Try Reddit Week 2 (per MINIMUM-VIABLE-LAUNCH.md)
   - Try Twitter threads Week 2 (different platform, different mechanics)
4. Increase journalist outreach volume:
   - Week 1: 10 contacts
   - Week 2: 20-30 contacts if 0 responses
   - Focus on freelancers (higher response rate than staff reporters)

### If Week 1 Succeeds (50K+ total views)

**Double down immediately:**
1. Create 2-3 follow-up videos Week 2 using winning angle
2. Spend $50-100 on TikTok Spark Ads for best-performing video
3. Expand to Instagram Reels Week 2 (reformat top TikTok content)
4. Set up Google Alert for "Luoxi baby surgery" (monitor if journalists covering)
5. Follow up with journalists who responded Week 1 (provide full materials)

## TECHNICAL TROUBLESHOOTING

### CapCut Issues

**"Text is too small on phone"**
→ Solution: Increase font size to 48-60pt minimum, use bold font, add black outline

**"Text animation looks wrong"**
→ Solution: Use "Fade" animation only (simplest, most reliable). Avoid complex animations until experienced.

**"Video exports blurry"**
→ Solution: Check export settings—must be 1080x1920, highest quality. If still blurry, source photos may be low-res.

**"Music won't sync"**
→ Solution: Use TikTok Sound Library (built-in, auto-syncs). Avoid importing external audio Week 1.

**"Can't find CapCut feature"**
→ Solution: YouTube search "[specific feature] CapCut tutorial 2026"—10min videos exist for every tool.

### TikTok Posting Issues

**"Video removed for copyright"**
→ Solution: Use TikTok Sound Library music only (royalty-free). If using external audio, must be licensed.

**"Video not getting views"**
→ Solution: Check if posted as "Friends only" (should be Public). Check if hashtags banned (use mainstream tags only).

**"Can't pin comment"**
→ Solution: Post comment, tap 3-dot menu on your own comment, select "Pin comment." Must be YOUR comment.

**"Analytics not showing"**
→ Solution: TikTok analytics appear 2-4 hours after posting. Refresh Creator Tools page. If still missing, check account is set to "Creator" mode (not personal).

## FINAL REMINDER

**You have everything you need:**
- 3 scripts (copy-paste ready)
- Timing marks (second-by-second)
- Caption templates (no writing needed)
- Hashtag recommendations (tested formulas)
- CTA/pinned comments (word-for-word)

**Zero creative decisions required. Just execute.**

**The grandmother photo is a 10/10 asset. The autopsy proof is ironclad. 3 great TikTok videos can reach 500K people for $0.**

**You can do this.**
