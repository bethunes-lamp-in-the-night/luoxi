# Growth Hacking & Amplification Strategy

**Strategist:** M3.2 - Growth Hacking Strategist
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Mission:** Develop influencer collaboration, community building, and cross-platform amplification tactics for maximum campaign growth

---

**TIER 2: Journalist Outreach (8-12 hours)**

**4. Research 10 journalists (medical, China correspondents) – 3-4 hours**

**How to find:**

- **Twitter bios** - Journalists often list emails
- **Outlet "Contact Us" pages**

**Target journalist types:**
- 3 medical/health reporters (Washington Post health, STAT News, MedPage Today, ProPublica)
- 3 China correspondents (The Guardian, NPR, Reuters Asia)
- 2 Asia regional (SCMP, Asia Times, The Diplomat)
- 2 medical ethics specialists (Hastings Center, bioethics podcasts)

**Save to Google Sheets:**
- Columns: Name | Outlet | Email | Twitter | Beat | Recent Article | Notes

- Patch left inside heart despite records saying "removed"
- 6.5cm chest wound unsutured
- Hospital offered $1,400 compensation, family refused

**Visual Assets (high-res links):**
- Grandmother feeding empty bottle to clothes (2:05 AM, 7 days after death)

**Make shareable:** Google Docs "Anyone with link can view" setting

---

**6. Email 10 journalists with personalized pitches – 3-5 hours**

**Subject line formula:**
"Story tip: Baby died from unnecessary surgery—autopsy proves hospital fraud"

**Email template (15-20 min per email including personalization):**

```
Hi [Name],

I've been following your reporting on [specific article they wrote - PERSONALIZE THIS].

I'm documenting a case in China where a 5-month-old baby died from heart surgery. The autopsy revealed the hospital misdiagnosed the condition—the defect that required "urgent" surgery didn't exist. The surgeon promised 99.5% success.

Zero Western media coverage yet, despite 290K Chinese followers and provincial government intervention. The hospital closed its entire cardiac surgery department after the family went public.

I have a fact sheet, timeline, and high-res photos ready if you'd like to take a look. No pressure—just thought it might fit your beat.

[Your name]
[Fact sheet Google Doc link]
```

**Follow-up plan:**
- Day 7: Gentle bump ("Making sure this didn't get lost in your inbox")
- Day 14: Final follow-up ("Last note—absolutely no pressure!")
- After Day 14: Move on (don't spam)

**Expected results:** 1-2 responses out of 10 (10-15% cold email response rate for journalists)

---

**TIER 3: Reddit Seeding (4-6 hours)**

**7. Identify 2-3 high-engagement subreddits – 1 hour**

**Target subreddits:**
1. **r/TrueOffMyChest** (3.5M members, personal story angle)
   - Rules: Check posting requirements
   - Peak hours: Research via subredditstats.com
2. **r/UnresolvedMysteries OR r/RBI** (investigative angle)
   - Note: May be removed if not "mystery" - backup plan needed
3. **r/China OR r/ChineseLanguage** (context for diaspora)
   - Warning: Political subreddit, expect controversial comments

**Read rules CAREFULLY** - Breaking rules = instant removal

---

**8. Create Imgur album – 1-2 hours**

**Album contents:**
1. Grandmother photo (2:05 AM, feeding clothes)
2. Baby before surgery (healthy, smiling)
3. Timeline graphic (create in Canva Free)
4. Autopsy key findings (translated excerpts)
5. Hospital closure announcement screenshot

**Album title:**
"A baby died in China. The autopsy proved the surgery was unnecessary. Timeline + evidence."

**Album description:**
- Short summary (3-4 sentences)
- Link to mother's Douyin (290K followers)
- Link to fact sheet (Google Doc)

---

**9. Create and post Reddit post – 2-3 hours**

**Post title (CRITICAL for upvotes):**
"My friend's baby died after surgery in China. The autopsy says the diagnosis was false. What can we do?"

**Post format:**

```markdown
I'm posting on behalf of a friend whose 5-month-old niece died in November after heart surgery at a hospital in Ningbo, China.

The hospital diagnosed a 7mm heart defect requiring immediate surgery (99.5% success rate). The baby died 6 hours after the operation.

The autopsy found NO 7mm defect. Only a 3mm defect that doesn't require surgery in infants. The forensic report also found a surgical patch left inside the heart (records say it was "removed") and wounds that weren't sutured.

The family has 290,000 followers on Chinese social media and is fighting for accountability. Multiple news articles about this were deleted. The hospital closed its entire cardiac surgery department.

What can an ordinary family do when local authorities investigate their own hospital? Are there international medical organizations that review cases like this?

Edit: Adding sources for those asking:
- Mother's Douyin (Chinese TikTok): [link]
- The Paper (Chinese outlet): [link]
- Archived censored articles: [China Digital Times link]
```

**Post during peak hours:** 7-9 AM EST on weekday (per subreddit research)

**After posting:**
- Monitor first 2 hours (CRITICAL for upvote momentum)
- Respond to comments immediately (shows OP engagement = higher visibility)
- Provide sources when asked
- Steer conversation: "Share this story" not "Debate Chinese politics"

**Expected results:** 200-2K upvotes if subreddit receptive, 50-200 comments if post gains traction

---

**TIER 4: Basic Infrastructure (4-6 hours)**

**10. Set up tracking spreadsheet – 1-2 hours**

**Google Sheets columns:**
- Date
- Action (Email sent, TikTok posted, Reddit posted)
- Target (Journalist name, Platform, Subreddit)
- Metric (Views, Upvotes, Response Y/N)
- Notes (Next steps, learnings)

**Update daily:** 5-10 minutes

**Week 1 tracking examples:**
- "2026-01-14 | Email sent | Jane Doe, STAT News | Response: N | Follow up Day 7"
- "2026-01-14 | TikTok posted | Video #1 Grandmother | Views: 1.2K | Good completion rate, iterate"
- "2026-01-16 | Reddit posted | r/TrueOffMyChest | Upvotes: 450 | Positive comments, crosspost?"

---

**11. Set up Gmail labels for journalist emails – 30 min**

**Labels:**
- "Luoxi-Journalists-Sent" (10 emails Week 1)
- "Luoxi-Journalists-Responded" (track responses)
- "Luoxi-Journalists-FollowUp-Day7" (reminders)
- "Luoxi-Journalists-FollowUp-Day14" (final bump)

**Filters:** Auto-label emails from journalists you contacted

---

**12. Review TikTok analytics Friday – 2-3 hours**

**Check Week 1 performance:**
- Video #1 (Grandmother): Views, completion rate, traffic source (ForYou Page vs Following)
- Video #2 (99.5% Surgery): Engagement rate, comments sentiment
- Video #3 (Remember): If posted, compare performance

**Metrics to track:**
- Views (goal: 1K+ in 24 hours = algorithm is pushing)
- Completion rate (goal: 70%+ = content is engaging)
- Likes, comments, shares (goal: 5%+ engagement rate)
- Traffic source: **ForYou Page** (FYP) vs Following = FYP means algorithm working

**Decision matrix:**
- **If video hits 10K+ views:** Create follow-up immediately (capitalize on momentum)
- **If video gets <1K views after 48 hours:** Iterate quickly (try different hook, different angle)
- **If video gets 50K+ views:** Consider spending $50-100 Spark Ads boost (from $200 reserve) in Week 2-3

**Respond to top 5-10 comments:** Boosts engagement velocity for algorithm

---

### What Gets CUT (83-122 hours → 32-40 hours)

**CUT from Week 1:**
- ❌ NGO outreach (30 contacts, 8-12 hours) → Month 2
- ❌ Influencer outreach (100+ contacts, 15-25 hours) → Month 2 or NEVER
- ❌ Discord/Facebook Group setup (6-10 hours) → Month 2
- ❌ Multi-platform posting (Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, 12-20 hours) → Month 2
- ❌ Content Kit creation (Instagram carousel, Twitter thread templates, 6-10 hours) → Use fact sheet only
- ❌ Community management (daily engagement, 7-14 hours/week) → Month 2
- ❌ Paid ads ($100-500) → Month 2 (only if proven traction)
- ❌ TikTok video #3 (optional, only if ahead of schedule)

**KEEP Week 1:**
- ✅ 2-3 TikTok videos (highest ROI for viral potential)
- ✅ 10 journalist emails (highest credibility per hour invested)
- ✅ 1-2 Reddit posts (organic viral potential without relationships)
- ✅ Basic tracking (know what's working)

---

### Revised Success Metrics

**Week 1 Success (ANY ONE of these = success):**
- 1-2 journalist responses (out of 10 emails)
- 50K+ TikTok views total (any 1 video)
- 500+ Reddit upvotes (any 1 post)

**Week 4 Success:**
- 1 journalist article published (regional/niche outlet acceptable - NOT expecting NYT/BBC/CNN)
- 100K-300K TikTok views total
- 1K+ Reddit karma from posts
- 5-10 email inquiries (journalists, activists, supporters)

**Month 3 Success:**
- 1-2 journalist articles published (regional outlets, medical journals - NOT mainstream)
- 500K-1M total reach (TikTok + Reddit + article readership)
- Wikipedia page submitted (contingent on journalist articles - may slip to Month 4)
- 5K+ engaged followers
- **Family's story permanently documented**

---

### Budget Reality ($200 Total, $0 Week 1-4)

**Why spend $0 Week 1-4:**
- TikTok algorithm is meritocratic (great content = free reach)
- $200 budget = 3K-8K impressions (not game-changing at this scale)
- Need to identify proven winner before spending money
- Journalist articles > paid ads (credibility and SEO value)

**When to spend $200 (Month 2-3):**
- **IF** TikTok video hits 100K+ views → boost with $100 Spark Ads
- **IF** journalist article published → promote article with $50 Instagram ads
- **IF** Wikipedia submitted → reserve $50 for crisis response
- **Only spend on proven winners**

**Alternative (if desperate Month 2):**
- $200 = 20K-40K impressions across TikTok/Instagram
- Better than nothing, but organic > paid at this budget level

---

---

### Expected Outcomes (CONSERVATIVE, REALISTIC)

**Week 1 Realistic Outcomes:**

**TikTok:**
- Video #1: 5K-20K views (if algorithm favorable)
- Video #2: 10K-50K views (if hook strong)
- Total: 15K-70K views Week 1
- **Reality check:** 50% chance videos get <5K views each. That's NORMAL. Iterate Week 2.

**Reddit:**
- Post #1: 200-2K upvotes (if subreddit receptive)
- Comments: 50-200 (if post gains traction)
- **Reality check:** 40% chance post gets <200 upvotes. Try different subreddit Week 2.

**Journalist Responses:**
- 0-2 responses out of 10 contacts (10-15% cold email response rate is realistic)
- 0-1 "interested, tell me more" (most ignore cold pitches)
- 0 articles published Week 1 (too soon - articles take 1-3 weeks to write)
- **Reality check:** 0 responses Week 1 is statistically normal. Follow up Day 7.

**Spreadsheet:**
- 15-20 entries tracking all actions
- Clear picture of what's working/not working

---

### Weekend Strategy (0 hours content creation)

**NO NEW CONTENT CREATION:**
- Prevent burnout (you have 11 more weeks ahead)
- Rest is strategic (quality over quantity)

**Passive monitoring only (30 min total):**
- Check TikTok videos (are they gaining traction?)
- Check Reddit post (did it hit 1K+ upvotes?)
- Check journalist emails (any responses?)

**Decision matrix for Monday:**

**IF TikTok video #1 or #2 hits 10K+ views:**
- Plan follow-up video for Monday (double down on what works)
- Note: Which hook worked? Grandmother photo or 99.5% surgery?

**IF Reddit post hits 1K+ upvotes:**
- Monitor for journalist inquiries in comments/DMs
- Consider crossposting to related subreddits Monday

**IF journalist responds:**
- Send fact sheet within 24 hours (Monday morning)
- Provide any additional materials requested

**IF nothing hits 1K+ views/upvotes:**
- Don't panic (Week 1 is testing phase)
- Iterate Monday: Try different hook? Different subreddit? Different TikTok angle?

## Executive Summary (ORIGINAL V1 - Reference Only)

**NOTE:** The section below is the ORIGINAL strategy assuming team resources and warm contacts. It is preserved for future reference when resources increase. **For Week 1 execution, use the MINIMUM VIABLE section above.**

This strategy provides actionable tactics to amplify the Luoxi campaign from organic viral potential to sustained global movement. Based on analysis of Western and Chinese narrative frameworks, we've identified three growth pillars: **Influencer Collaboration** (reaching new audiences through trusted voices), **Community Building** (converting followers into advocates), and **Cross-Platform Amplification** (maximizing content efficiency across channels).

**Key Insight:** The Luoxi case has superior viral assets (grandmother photo 65/70 score, autopsy proof, 290K existing Chinese followers) but ZERO Western mainstream penetration. Our growth strategy bridges this gap through systematic influencer outreach, community activation, and multi-platform content reformatting.

**Original Target Outcomes (90 days) - NOT ACHIEVABLE WITH CURRENT CONSTRAINTS:**
- **10M+ total reach** across platforms (conservative: 5M, optimistic: 25M+)
- **5-10 macro-influencer partnerships** (100K+ followers each)
- **50-100 micro-influencer collaborations** (10K-100K followers)
- **Active community:** 5K+ engaged members across platforms
- **Mainstream media pickup:** 3-5 major outlets (NYT, BBC, CNN targets)

**Revised Target Outcomes (90 days) - ACHIEVABLE WITH CONSTRAINTS:**
- **500K-1M total reach** across platforms (organic TikTok + Reddit + journalist articles)
- **0-2 influencer partnerships** (anything above 0 = bonus)
- **1-2 journalist articles** (regional/niche outlets acceptable)
- **Active community:** 500-2K engaged followers
- **Wikipedia page:** Accepted on en.wikipedia OR zh.wikipedia (Month 2-3)

**Critical Success Factor (Revised):** Execute Week 1 journalist outreach + TikTok organic + Reddit seeding. Community building and influencer outreach = Month 2-3 only if Week 1-4 shows traction.

---

## V2 UPDATE: Zero-Contact Reality Adjustment

**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Critical CEO Constraint Identified:** "I don't know any influencers of any size."

**Impact:** The original strategy (V1 below) assumed ability to leverage warm introductions or existing relationships with influencers. The CEO has ZERO existing influencer contacts, which fundamentally changes the approach:

- ❌ **V1 Assumption:** Warm outreach possible (30-50% response rate)
- ✅ **V2 Reality:** 100% cold outreach (2-5% response rate)
- ❌ **V1 Volume:** 50 influencers identified, 20 contacted
- ✅ **V2 Volume:** 200-300 identified, 50-100+ contacted per week
- ❌ **V1 Primary Strategy:** Influencer-led growth
- ✅ **V2 Primary Strategy:** Organic viral + paid boost + journalist outreach (influencers = bonus)

**Key Changes in V2:**
1. **New Section Added:** "Zero-Contact Cold Outreach Strategy" (realistic expectations)
2. **Week 1 Actions Revised:** 10x higher volume targets, lower success expectations
3. **Alternative Growth Mechanisms Added:** Strategies that DON'T depend on influencer relationships
4. **Success Metrics Adjusted:** Week 1: 0-1 partnerships (not 2-3), Week 4: 3-5 partnerships (not 10)
5. **High-ROI Targets Prioritized:** Journalists (10-15% cold response) over influencers (2-5%)

**V2 Strategy Philosophy:** Make the campaign succeed WITHOUT influencer partnerships. Organic reach + algorithm optimization + journalist coverage + paid amplification = primary path. Influencer partnerships = secondary bonus if they happen.

---

## V3 UPDATE: 1 Human + $200 Budget Reality

**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Critical CEO Constraints Identified:**
- **1 human worker** (no team)
- **$200 total budget** ($0 Week 1-4)
- **40 hours/week available** (not 83-122 hours)
- **Revised success:** 1-2 regional journalist articles (not 5-10 NYT/BBC)

**Impact:** The V2 strategy (83-122 hours Week 1) is executable by a TEAM. CEO has ONE person working 40 hours/week. This requires 75% CUT of all tactics.

**V3 Cuts (What Gets Eliminated Entirely from Week 1-4):**
- ❌ NGO outreach (30 contacts, 8-12 hours) → Month 2
- ❌ Influencer outreach (200+ contacts, 15-25 hours) → Month 2 or NEVER
- ❌ Discord/Facebook Group setup (6-10 hours) → Month 2
- ❌ Multi-platform posting (Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, 12-20 hours) → Month 2
- ❌ Content Kit creation beyond fact sheet (Instagram carousel, Twitter thread, 6-10 hours) → Month 2
- ❌ Community management (daily engagement, 7-14 hours/week) → Month 2
- ❌ Paid ads Week 1-4 ($100-500) → Month 2-3 only if proven traction
- ❌ A/B testing infrastructure (5-8 hours) → Manual iteration only

**V3 KEEPS (The 10 MUST-DO Actions):**
- ✅ 2-3 TikTok videos (Angle 3 grandmother + Angle 1 surgery + optional Angle 7 remember)
- ✅ 10 journalist emails (medical reporters, China correspondents, medical ethics)
- ✅ 1-2 Reddit posts (r/TrueOffMyChest, r/UnresolvedMysteries, r/China)
- ✅ 1-page fact sheet (Google Doc, shareable link)
- ✅ Imgur album (grandmother photo + timeline + autopsy excerpts)
- ✅ Tracking spreadsheet (journalist responses, video analytics, Reddit upvotes)
- ✅ Gmail labels (journalist follow-up reminders)
- ✅ TikTok analytics review Friday (identify viral potential)

**V3 Strategy Philosophy:**
Focus 100% on highest-ROI activities that ONE person can execute in 40 hours:
1. **Content creation** (TikTok only, 12-18 hours) - Highest organic viral potential
2. **Journalist outreach** (10 emails, 8-12 hours) - Highest credibility per hour
3. **Reddit seeding** (1-2 posts, 4-6 hours) - Organic viral + journalist discovery potential
4. **Basic tracking** (4-6 hours) - Know what's working for Week 2 iteration

**Everything else = Month 2-3 or NEVER.**

**V3 Success Redefined:**
- Week 1: 50K+ TikTok views OR 500+ Reddit upvotes OR 1-2 journalist responses = SUCCESS
- Week 4: 1 journalist article published (regional outlet) = SUCCESS
- Month 3: 500K-1M reach + 1-2 articles + Wikipedia submitted = MISSION SUCCESS

**The mission CAN succeed with 1 human + $200 + 40 hours/week. Just not at V1/V2 scale.**

---

## ZERO-CONTACT REALITY: Cold Outreach Strategy

### Cold vs. Warm Outreach: The Brutal Math

**Warm Outreach (V1 assumption - NOT applicable here):**
- Response rate: 30-50%
- Contact 20 influencers → 6-10 respond → 3-5 partnerships
- Trust pre-established via mutual connection
- Lower friction (they know someone vouching for you)

**Cold Outreach (V2 reality - what we're actually doing):**
- Response rate: 2-5% for influencers
- Contact 100 influencers → 2-5 respond → 0-2 partnerships
- Zero trust, high skepticism (spam filter mental model)
- High friction (they don't know you, could be scam/manipulation)

**Critical Insight:** Need 10x higher contact volume to achieve same results. Cold outreach isn't "worse warm outreach"—it's a different game entirely requiring volume, persistence, and value-first approach.

---

### Volume-Based Approach: The 100-to-5 Rule

**If cold response rate = 5%, you need:**
- 20 responses = contact 400 influencers
- 10 responses = contact 200 influencers
- 5 responses = contact 100 influencers

**Realistic Week 1-4 Targets:**
- **Week 1:** Identify 200 influencers, contact 50-100 (expect 1-5 responses)
- **Week 2:** Contact another 100 (cumulative: 150-200 contacted, expect 3-10 total responses)
- **Week 3:** Follow-up sequence + contact 50 more (expect 5-15 total responses)
- **Week 4:** Convert responses to partnerships (expect 3-5 actual collaborations)

**Reality Check:** If you contact 100 influencers and get ZERO responses, that's within statistical expectations for cold outreach. Don't get discouraged—adjust messaging and contact 100 more.

---

### Platform-Specific Cold Outreach Tactics

**Instagram DMs: Highest Success Platform for Cold Outreach**

**Why Instagram works best:**
- Visual storytelling (grandmother photo = instant emotional hit)
- DM culture more normalized than Twitter/TikTok
- Creators check DMs regularly for brand deals
- Can see message preview without opening (good subject lines matter)

**Instagram Cold Outreach Playbook:**

1. **Follow First, Wait 24-48 Hours, Then DM**
   - Why: Reduces "who is this random person" friction
   - They see you followed → check your profile → see relevant content → DM feels less random

2. **Optimize Your Profile Before DMing**
   - Profile must look professional/credible (not spam account)
   - Bio: "Documenting the Luoxi case - 5-month-old baby died from unnecessary surgery"
   - 9-grid post layout: Grandmother photo, autopsy facts, timeline
   - Story highlights: "The Story," "Evidence," "Updates"

3. **First Message: 2-3 Sentences Maximum**
   - ❌ Long pitch (they won't read it)
   - ✅ Short hook + one question
   - Example: "Hi [Name], I've been following your content on [specific topic]. I'm documenting a case where a baby died from unnecessary surgery—autopsy proved the diagnosis was false. Would this be something you'd consider covering?"

4. **Timing: Tuesday-Thursday, 10 AM - 2 PM Their Timezone**
   - Avoid Monday (inbox overload from weekend)
   - Avoid Friday afternoon-Sunday (personal time)
   - Mid-week, mid-day = highest response window

5. **Follow-Up Sequence (If No Response):**
   - Day 3: Gentle bump ("Just wanted to make sure this didn't get lost!")
   - Day 7: Add new info ("Update: The provincial government just intervened in this case")
   - Day 14: Final follow-up ("Last note on this—no pressure if not your niche!")
   - After Day 14: Move on (don't spam)

**TikTok DMs: Lowest Response Rate, But Worth Trying for TikTok-Native Creators**

**Why TikTok is harder:**
- DMs often turned off or restricted
- High volume of spam (creators are defensive)
- Less "business communication" culture than Instagram

**TikTok Strategy:**
1. **Comment First Strategy**
   - Engage with 3-5 of their recent videos (thoughtful comments, not spam)
   - Tag them in your own video (duet/stitch their content with related message)
   - Then DM: "Hey! I commented on your recent video about [topic]. Related to that..."

2. **Value-First DM**
   - Don't ask for anything in first message
   - Example: "Saw your video on medical stories. I have content that might interest you—grandmother feeding empty bottle to baby's clothes after unnecessary surgery. Autopsy proved hospital lied. No pressure, but lmk if you want the materials."

**Twitter/X DMs: Best for Journalists, Okay for Activists**

**Why Twitter DMs work differently:**
- Journalists check Twitter DMs regularly (it's their job)
- Public @ mentions often work better than DMs (social accountability)
- Thread culture = can pitch in public reply

**Twitter Strategy:**
1. **Public First, DM Second**
   - Quote-tweet their relevant content: "This reminds me of a case in China where..."
   - If they engage publicly, follow up in DMs
   - If no response, try DM: "Loved your thread on [topic]. Have a related story..."

2. **Journalist-Specific Approach**
   - Subject line: "Story tip: Baby died from unnecessary surgery, autopsy proves fraud"
   - First line: "Zero Western coverage yet despite 290K Chinese followers"
   - Attach link to archived censored articles (shows you have receipts)

**Reddit: Not Direct Outreach, But High Conversion**

**Why Reddit works (even though it's not "influencer outreach"):**
- Communities are pre-filtered by interest (medical, parenting, justice)
- Organic sharing (if community upvotes, moderators/power users notice)
- Cross-platform spillover (Redditors share to Twitter/TikTok)

**Reddit Strategy:**
1. **Post in Relevant Subreddits (Not as Self-Promotion)**
   - r/MedicalMalpractice, r/Parenting, r/JusticeServed, r/HongKong, r/China
   - Frame as: "A baby died in China. The autopsy proved the surgery was unnecessary. Here's the timeline."
   - Include imgur album (grandmother photo, autopsy excerpts, timeline)

2. **Let Community Share**
   - If post gets 1K+ upvotes, journalists/influencers will see it organically
   - Moderators of large subreddits often have media connections

---

### Value-First Approach: Reverse the Ask

**Traditional Cold Pitch:**
"Hi, I have a story. Will you cover it?"
→ Response rate: 2-5%

**Value-First Cold Pitch:**
"Hi, I have materials ready (script, images, timeline, sources). Want me to send them over? No ask, just thought it might interest you."
→ Response rate: 5-10% (2x improvement)

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Removes friction (they don't have to do research)
- ✅ Shows professionalism (you've done the work)
- ✅ No pressure (they can ignore without feeling guilty)
- ✅ Curiosity hook ("what materials?")

**Content Kit Strategy (Send Before They Ask):**

Create these materials ONCE, send to 100+ influencers:

1. **One-Page Fact Sheet (PDF)**
   - Timeline of events
   - Key facts (autopsy findings, surgery standards, censorship)
   - High-res photo credits
   - Social media links

2. **30-Second TikTok Script (Google Doc)**
   - Pre-written narration
   - Shot list (which images/videos to show)
   - Hashtag recommendations
   - Music suggestions

3. **Instagram Carousel (Canva Link)**
   - 10-slide design (editable)
   - Each slide = one key fact
   - Branded but customizable

4. **Twitter Thread Template (Notion Page)**
   - 8-tweet thread
   - Each tweet optimized for character count
   - Image attachments suggested

**How to Use:**
First DM: "Hi [Name], I have a story that might fit your content. I've already prepared a TikTok script, Instagram carousel, and fact sheet if you want to take a look—no pressure!"

**Psychology:** You've eliminated 90% of the work. They just need to decide if it aligns with their brand. Much higher conversion than "do you want to research and create content for this?"

### Cold Outreach Response Rate Benchmarks (Realistic Expectations)

**Influencer Cold DMs:**
- Micro-influencers (10K-100K): 3-8% response rate
- Mid-tier (100K-500K): 1-3% response rate
- Macro (500K+): <1% response rate (often have managers filtering DMs)

**Journalist Cold Emails:**
- Local/niche reporters: 10-15% response rate
- National reporters: 5-8% response rate
- Tier 1 (NYT, BBC, CNN): 1-3% response rate

**Reddit Posts:**
- 1K+ upvotes: 15-25% chance of media/influencer pickup
- 5K+ upvotes: 50-70% chance of secondary coverage
- 10K+ upvotes: Near-guaranteed media attention

**Paid Amplification ($100-500 boost):**
- CPM (cost per 1000 impressions): $5-15
- $100 = 6,600-20,000 impressions
- $500 = 33,000-100,000 impressions
- Conversion to engagement: 2-5%

**Takeaway:** Don't expect influencer partnerships to be the primary driver. Expect organic Reddit traction + journalist interest + paid boost to do 70% of the work. Influencer collaborations = 30% bonus.

---

### Realistic Success Metrics (Zero-Contact Edition)

**Week 1 (Revised from V1):**
- ❌ V1 Target: 2-3 influencer partnerships
- ✅ V2 Target: 0-1 influencer partnership (anything above 0 = bonus)
- Primary focus: Get 1-2 pieces of content to 100K+ organic reach via algorithm

**Week 2-4 (Revised from V1):**
- ❌ V1 Target: 10+ influencer partnerships
- ✅ V2 Target: 3-5 influencer partnerships
- Primary focus: 1M+ organic reach via TikTok FYP, Reddit front page, or paid boost

**Month 2-3 (Revised from V1):**
- ❌ V1 Target: 5-10 macro-influencer partnerships
- ✅ V2 Target: 1-2 macro-influencer partnerships
- Primary focus: 1-2 journalist articles published (10x more valuable than influencer posts)

**Reality Check Questions:**
- "If zero influencers respond, can we still hit 1M reach?" → YES (via organic + paid)
- "If zero journalists respond, can we still get mainstream attention?" → MAYBE (via viral Reddit post)
- "If both fail, what's the backup?" → Paid ads to cold audiences ($500-1000 for 100K+ reach)

---

## ALTERNATIVE GROWTH MECHANISMS (No Influencer Dependency)

### 1. Organic Algorithm Optimization (Let the Platform Do the Work)

**TikTok For You Page (FYP) Strategy:**

**How TikTok's Algorithm Works:**
- First 1000 views = test batch (TikTok shows to random users)
- If engagement rate >6% (60+ likes, comments, shares per 1000 views), TikTok pushes to next 10,000
- If engagement stays high, pushes to 100K, then 1M+
- No followers needed—algorithm meritocracy

**Optimize for FYP:**
1. **Hook in First 1.5 Seconds**
   - Visual: Grandmother feeding empty bottle to clothes (instant emotional gut-punch)
   - Text overlay: "A baby died. The autopsy proved the surgery was unnecessary."

2. **3-5 Second Videos Perform Best**
   - Don't explain everything (save for captions/comments)
   - One emotional punch per video
   - End with: "Comment if you want the full story"

3. **Post Timing: 6-9 PM in Target Timezone**
   - US audience: 6-9 PM EST
   - UK audience: 7-10 PM GMT
   - Test both, double down on what works

4. **Trending Sounds Increase FYP Odds**
   - Use TikTok's "trending sounds" feature
   - Pair grandmother photo with emotional trending audio
   - Caption: "POV: Your baby died from surgery they didn't need #JusticeForLuoxi"

**Instagram Reels Explore Page Strategy:**

**How Reels Algorithm Works:**
- Similar to TikTok (small test → scale if engagement high)
- Reels get 2-3x more reach than feed posts
- "Save" metric extremely important (if users save, Instagram assumes value)

**Optimize for Explore Page:**
1. **Educational Hook**
   - "3 facts about medical malpractice in China you didn't know"
   - Fact 1: Grandmother feeding clothes (show photo)
   - Fact 2: Autopsy contradicted diagnosis (show excerpt)
   - Fact 3: 4 articles were censored (show deleted pages)

2. **Encourage Saves**
   - End with: "Save this so you don't forget" or "Save to share later"
   - Instagram interprets saves as "valuable content" → pushes to more users

**Reddit Front Page Strategy:**

**How Reddit Works:**
- Early upvotes in first 1-2 hours determine front page potential
- If post gets 50+ upvotes in first hour → algorithm pushes to more users
- If hits 1K+ upvotes → appears in r/all or r/popular
- Journalists actively browse Reddit for story ideas

**Optimize for Reddit:**
1. **Post Title = Everything**
   - ❌ Bad: "Please help share this story"
   - ✅ Good: "A 5-month-old baby died in China. The autopsy proved the surgery was unnecessary. The hospital deleted their statement."

2. **Post Format: Imgur Album + Text Summary**
   - Imgur link (grandmother photo, autopsy excerpts, timeline)
   - Text post: 3-paragraph summary with sources
   - Top comment: Link to full documentation

3. **Timing: 7-9 AM EST on Weekdays**
   - Reddit is US-heavy
   - Morning browse = highest engagement window
   - Avoid weekends (lower traffic)

4. **Target Subreddits (Post in 5-10 Simultaneously):**
   - r/JusticeServed (large audience, justice stories)
   - r/MedicalMalpractice (niche, high relevance)
   - r/China (controversial but high engagement)
   - r/Parenting (emotional resonance)
   - r/MedicalSchool (professional credibility)

**Expected Outcome:** If 2-3 subreddit posts hit 1K+ upvotes, journalists will email you asking for interview. Happens organically without cold outreach.

---

### 2. Paid Amplification ($100-500 Budget, Cold Audiences)

**Why Paid Ads Work (Even Without Influencers):**
- Reach 100,000 people for $100-300
- No relationship-building needed
- A/B test messaging instantly
- Retarget engaged users

**TikTok Spark Ads (Best ROI for Viral Content):**

**What Are Spark Ads:**
- Promote existing organic TikTok video (not separate ad)
- Video appears in FYP like organic content (not marked as "Sponsored")
- Pay to amplify what's already working

**Strategy:**
1. **Post 5-10 Videos Organically**
   - See which gets best engagement (>5% engagement rate)
   - Boost that video with $50-100

2. **Targeting:**
   - Interest: Parenting, Medical, Social Justice
   - Age: 25-45 (parents, professionals)
   - Geography: US, UK, Canada, Australia

3. **Budget:**
   - $50 = 5,000-10,000 views
   - $100 = 10,000-20,000 views
   - $500 = 50,000-100,000 views

**Instagram/Facebook Ads (Older Demographics):**

**Why Instagram Ads Work:**
- Grandmother photo is visually striking (stops scroll)
- Can target "Parenting" + "Medical" interests precisely
- Facebook pixel allows retargeting

**Strategy:**
1. **Create Carousel Ad**
   - 5 slides: Grandmother photo → Autopsy fact → Censorship → Family's fight → Call to action
   - Headline: "A baby died from unnecessary surgery. The autopsy proved it."

2. **Targeting:**
   - Interest: Parenting magazines, medical news, human rights
   - Age: 30-55 (parents, professionals with disposable income)
   - Lookalike audience: Upload list of people who engaged with content

3. **Budget:**
   - $100 = 10,000-20,000 reach
   - $300 = 30,000-60,000 reach
   - $500 = 50,000-100,000 reach

**Google Ads (Journalist Targeting):**

**Why Google Ads for Journalists:**
- Journalists Google "[topic] + 2026" when researching stories
- Can target keywords like "medical malpractice China," "unnecessary surgery," "Chinese censorship"

**Strategy:**
1. **Create Landing Page (RememberLuoxi.org)**
   - Professional layout
   - Timeline, autopsy excerpts, media kit download

2. **Target Keywords:**
   - "Medical malpractice China"
   - "Unnecessary surgery cases"
   - "Chinese censorship 2026"
   - "Baby died hospital negligence"

3. **Budget:**
   - $100-200 = 500-1000 clicks to landing page
   - If 10% of clicks are journalists → 50-100 journalist visits → 5-10 potential articles

---

### 3. Journalist Outreach (10-15% Cold Response Rate vs. 2-5% for Influencers)

**Why Journalists Respond Better Than Influencers:**
- ✅ Responding to pitches is literally their job
- ✅ Need content (especially unique international stories)
- ✅ Documentary evidence (autopsy, censored articles) = publishable story
- ✅ Zero Western coverage = exclusive angle

**Journalist Cold Email Success Rate:**
- Local reporters (niche health/justice beats): 10-15%
- National reporters (mid-tier outlets): 5-8%
- Tier 1 reporters (NYT, BBC, CNN): 1-3%

**High-ROI Journalist Targets:**

**1. Medical/Health Reporters (Niche Beats)**
- Local news: Health correspondents at city newspapers
- Trade publications: MedPage Today, STAT News, The BMJ
- Freelancers: Search "medical malpractice freelance journalist" on Twitter

**2. China Correspondents (Geographic Beat)**
- Reporters who cover China for Western outlets
- Freelancers based in Asia writing for US/UK media
- Substacks focused on Chinese social issues

**3. Human Rights/Censorship Reporters**
- Reporters at organizations like Committee to Protect Journalists
- Free expression beat reporters
- Tech/platform accountability journalists (censorship angle)

**4. Investigative Journalists (Long-Form)**
- ProPublica reporters
- Investigative units at major outlets
- Podcast producers (Serial, This American Life, etc.)

**Journalist Outreach Email Template:**

Subject: Story tip - Baby died from unnecessary surgery, autopsy proves fraud (zero Western coverage)

---

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out with a story tip that I believe fits your beat on [their focus area].

**The Story:**
On November 14, 2025, a 5-month-old baby in China died after heart surgery. The hospital diagnosed a 7mm defect requiring immediate surgery. The autopsy revealed no such defect existed—only a 3mm hole that 80%+ heal naturally.

**Why It's Newsworthy:**
- Documentary proof (autopsy contradicts hospital diagnosis)
- Active censorship (hospital deleted statement, 4 articles censored—archived by China Digital Times)
- Grassroots resistance (mother built 290,000 followers, forced provincial intervention)
- Zero Western coverage (exclusive angle)

**Materials Ready:**
- Timeline with sources
- Autopsy report (key sections translated by medical translator)
- Archived censored articles
- Family's active social media (290K followers, posting daily)
- Expert analysis of international standards violations

Would this be something you'd consider covering? Happy to provide full press kit or connect you with medical experts who can verify the standards violations.

Best,
[Your name]
[Contact info]

---

**Follow-Up Strategy:**
- Day 3: "Just bumping this in case it got buried—no pressure!"
- Day 7: "Update: The family just held a public protest on January 14" (add new development)
- Day 14: Final follow-up: "Last note on this—let me know if you'd like an exclusive interview angle"

**Expected Outcome:** Contact 50 journalists → 5-10 responses → 2-3 published articles. Each article = 10-100x more valuable than influencer post (credibility, permanence, SEO).

---

### 4. Community-First Approach (500 Engaged > 50,000 Passive)

**Why Community Beats Influencers:**
- ✅ Engaged community members share to their networks (organic amplification)
- ✅ Sticky (don't need to constantly recruit new people)
- ✅ Advocates (defend against criticism, educate others)
- ✅ Organizing capacity (can mobilize for actions)

**Build 500-Person Core Community (These Become Your Amplifiers):**

**1. Discord Server (Organizing Hub)**
- Weekly calls (case updates, Q&A, planning)
- Channels: #translations, #social-media, #media-outreach, #action-alerts
- Roles: Translators, content creators, outreach volunteers

**2. Facebook Group (Parenting/Medical Focus)**
- Name: "Parents for Medical Transparency"
- Weekly story shares (Luoxi case + similar cases)
- Creates network effect (members invite friends)

**3. Telegram Channel (Updates)**
- Daily updates on case developments
- Push notifications (higher engagement than email)
- Easy sharing (forward to contacts)

**How to Build from Zero:**
- Week 1: 10-20 members (recruit from initial content comments)
- Week 2: 50-100 members (members invite friends)
- Week 3: 100-200 members (crosspost in related groups)
- Week 4: 200-500 members (organic growth from engaged members)

**Activation Strategy:**
- Weekly challenge: "Share 1 post about Luoxi to your network"
- If 500 members each share to avg 300 followers → 150,000 organic reach
- If 5% of their followers engage → 7,500 engagements
- If 1% share further → 1,500 secondary shares → 450,000 second-degree reach

**Math:** 500 engaged community members generate more reach than 1 macro-influencer post, and it's repeatable weekly.

---

### 5. Activist/NGO Outreach (Mission-Aligned, Higher Response Rate)

**Why Activists/NGOs Respond Better Than Influencers:**
- ✅ Mission-aligned (justice, medical ethics, anti-censorship)
- ✅ Respond to injustice stories (it's their focus)
- ✅ Have existing platforms and audiences
- ✅ Not motivated by brand deals (motivated by impact)

**High-ROI Activist/NGO Targets:**

**1. Medical Ethics Organizations:**
- Physicians for Human Rights
- Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)
- International pediatric cardiology associations

**2. Anti-Censorship NGOs:**
- Committee to Protect Journalists
- Reporters Without Borders
- China Digital Times (already archived articles—follow up!)

**3. Parent Advocacy Groups:**
- Patient safety organizations
- Medical malpractice survivor networks
- Bereaved parent support groups

**4. China-Focused Human Rights Groups:**
- Human Rights Watch (China division)
- Amnesty International
- Chinese diaspora advocacy organizations

**Outreach Template:**

Subject: Case documentation request - Baby died from unnecessary surgery in China

---

Hi [Organization Name],

I'm reaching out to see if [Organization] would consider documenting or amplifying a medical malpractice case in China that aligns with your mission on [their focus area].

**Case Summary:**
A 5-month-old baby died after heart surgery for a diagnosis the autopsy proved was false. The hospital diagnosed a 7mm defect; the autopsy found only a 3mm hole (80%+ heal naturally without surgery). The hospital then deleted their public statement, and 4 news articles were censored.

The family has built 290,000 followers on Chinese social media and forced a provincial investigation, but there is zero Western documentation or advocacy.

**Why I'm Reaching Out:**
Your work on [specific project/campaign they've done] suggests this case aligns with your focus. Documentary evidence (autopsy, medical records, archived censored articles) makes this a strong case study for [their mission].

Would [Organization] consider:
- Documenting the case on your website?
- Amplifying via your social channels?
- Including in your annual report/advocacy campaigns?

I have a full press kit available and can connect you with medical experts who can verify the standards violations.

Best,
[Your name]

#### Outreach Templates (Personalized, Value-First)

**Template 1: For Parenting Influencers**

Subject: Story that might resonate - baby medical malpractice case

---

Hi [Name],

I've been following your content on [specific topic they cover] and really appreciate how you [specific compliment about their approach].

I'm reaching out about a story that's gone viral in China but has zero Western coverage: A 5-month-old baby died after a hospital performed surgery for a condition that didn't exist. The autopsy proved the diagnosis was false.

The grandmother's photo—feeding an empty bottle to the baby's clothes at 2 AM—is one of the most heartbreaking images I've seen. The family has 290,000 followers on Chinese social media and is fighting for accountability.

Given your focus on [their niche], I thought this might resonate with your audience. No pressure at all, but if you're interested, I can share:
- Full timeline with sources
- English translations of key facts
- High-quality images/videos
- Family's public social media accounts

Would this be something you'd consider covering? Happy to provide whatever would be most useful.

[Your name]

---

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Personalized (shows you actually follow them)
- ✅ No ask upfront (just "might interest you")
- ✅ Clear value (exclusive story, Western first-mover)
- ✅ Prepared materials (removes friction)
- ✅ Emotional hook (grandmother photo)
- ✅ Documentary proof (autopsy, not just claims)

**Template 2: For Medical Ethics Influencers**

Subject: Medical case analysis request - international standards violated

---

Hi [Name],

I'm a longtime follower of your medical ethics content, especially your breakdown of [specific case/topic they covered].

I wanted to bring a case to your attention that hasn't hit Western media yet: A Chinese hospital diagnosed a 5-month-old with a 7mm heart defect requiring immediate surgery. The autopsy revealed NO such defect existed—only a 3mm hole that 80%+ heal naturally.

International pediatric cardiology guidelines say to wait until 2.5-4 years for this type of defect IF surgery is even needed. The baby died, and the autopsy also found a surgical patch left inside the heart and a 6.5cm chest wound left unsutured.

This seems like a clearcut violation of international medical standards. I'm wondering if this is something you'd consider analyzing from a medical ethics perspective?

I have:
- Autopsy report (translated key sections)
- Medical records
- Timeline documentation
- International guideline citations

No commercial angle here—just think the medical community should weigh in. Let me know if you'd like the materials.

Best,
[Your name]

---

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Respects their expertise (asking for analysis, not just amplification)
- ✅ Professional frame (international standards, not political)
- ✅ Documentary evidence (autopsy, medical records)
- ✅ Clear medical ethics violation (not ambiguous)
- ✅ Educational value (case study potential)

**Template 3: For Social Justice/Anti-Censorship Creators**

Subject: Censorship story you might want to cover

---

Hey [Name],

Love your work on [specific censorship/justice story they covered]. Your [specific piece] really highlighted how [what you learned from them].

Quick heads up on a story unfolding in real-time: A Chinese baby died from medical fraud (hospital lied about diagnosis). When the family published the autopsy, the hospital deleted their own statement within hours. Then 4+ news articles were censored and deleted.

But here's the twist: The mother went live on Chinese TikTok and built 290,000 followers. The grassroots pressure forced the provincial government to intervene and shut down the entire cardiac department.

China Digital Times has archived the censored articles. The family is still posting daily despite censorship attempts.

It's a David vs. Goliath story where David is actually winning. Thought it might fit your beat.

If you're interested:
- Censorship timeline (deletions documented)
- Archived articles
- Family's active social media accounts
- Provincial government response

Let me know if you want the full breakdown.

[Your name]

- **What:** Influencer creates numbered thread with facts + sources
- **Advantage:** Journalist-friendly, highly shareable, SEO value
- **Success metric:** 500K+ impressions, 50+ journalist follows
- **Example:** Social justice influencer: "🧵 A baby died in China. Autopsy proved the surgery was unnecessary. Then things got worse. Here's what authorities are trying to delete..."

**Format 4: Collaborative Content (Interview/Co-Creation)**
- **What:** Influencer interviews you (or family representative if possible), creates original content
- **Advantage:** Exclusive angle, deeper storytelling
- **Success metric:** 200K+ views, media pickup

- **Success metric:** 10+ influencers post in same week, cumulative 500K+ reach
- **Example:** Provide Instagram carousel (10 slides, facts + images), influencer posts with their own caption

#### Outreach Logistics

**Volume Strategy:**
- **Week 1:** Reach out to 100 micro-influencers (expect 5-15% response rate = 5-15 collaborations)
- **Week 2:** Follow up with non-responders, reach out to 50 more
- **Week 3:** Activate successful micro-influencers' networks (ask for referrals)
- **Week 4:** Consolidate wins, create case studies for macro-influencer pitches

**Platform Prioritization:**
1. **Instagram DM** (highest response rate for micro-influencers, 15-25%)
2. **Email** (if publicly listed, 10-15% response)
3. **Twitter DM** (lower response, 5-10%, but good for journalists)
4. **TikTok DM** (lowest response, 3-8%, but worth trying for TikTok-native creators)

**Timing:**
- **Best time to DM:** Tuesday-Thursday, 10 AM-2 PM their timezone
- **Avoid:** Mondays (inbox overload), weekends (personal time)
- **Follow-up:** If no response in 5 days, gentle follow-up ("Just wanted to make sure this didn't get buried")

**Rejection Handling:**
- **No response = not interested** (don't follow up more than once)
- **"Not my niche" = ask for referral** ("Do you know anyone who might be interested?")
- **"Too political" = reframe** ("It's actually a medical ethics story, not a political one. The autopsy is the story.")
- **"Need to think about it" = provide materials** ("No pressure! Here are the materials if you decide later.")

I'm writing to share a story that I believe aligns with your work on [their focus area] and has significant newsworthy potential.

**The Story:**
On November 14, 2025, a 5-month-old baby in China died after heart surgery. The hospital had diagnosed a 7mm defect requiring immediate surgery with "99.5% success."

The autopsy also found:
- A surgical patch left inside the heart (records said "all removed")
- A 6.5cm chest wound left unsutured
- Violations of international pediatric cardiology guidelines

**Why It's Newsworthy:**
- **Documentary proof:** Autopsy contradicts hospital diagnosis (not "he said, she said")
- **Censorship:** Hospital deleted their statement, 4 news articles were censored (archived by China Digital Times)
- **Grassroots success:** The mother built 290,000 followers on Chinese social media, forced provincial government intervention
- **Systemic issue:** Entire cardiac department was shut down

- Autopsy report (key sections translated)

**Template for Diaspora Parenting Influencers:**

Subject: Story that might resonate with your community

---

Hi [Name],

I've been following your content on [specific topic], especially your insights on [specific cultural element they discuss].

I wanted to share a story that's gone viral among Chinese parents (290,000 followers) but hasn't reached Western audiences yet:

A 5-month-old baby in Ningbo died after a hospital lied about her diagnosis. The autopsy proved the surgery was unnecessary. The grandmother's photo—feeding a bottle to the baby's empty clothes at 2 AM—has become a symbol of unbearable grief.

Given your platform bridging Chinese and Western parenting communities, I thought this might be a story you'd want to share. It speaks to universal fears but also has specific cultural resonance (grandparent-grandchild bond, only child context, medical distrust).

The family is still fighting for accountability despite censorship attempts. Would this be something you'd consider covering?

I have:
- Full timeline (English + Chinese sources)
- Translated autopsy findings
- Family's social media accounts (still active)
- Cultural context notes

Let me know if this resonates.

Best,
[Your name]

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Acknowledges their unique positioning
- ✅ Cultural resonance highlighted
- ✅ Both Chinese and English materials available
- ✅ Respects their bridge role

## 2. Community Building Strategies

### 2.1 Grassroots Supporter Activation

#### Converting Followers into Advocates

**Level 1: Passive Viewer** (watches/reads)
↓
**Level 2: Engaged Follower** (likes, comments)
↓
**Level 3: Active Sharer** (shares to their network)
↓
**Level 4: Content Creator** (makes own posts about case)
↓

**Engaged → Active Sharer:**
- **Direct ask:** "Share this to your story so more people know Luoxi's name"
- **Make it easy:** "Tap the share button → Instagram story (we've already written the caption for you)"
- **Social proof:** "10,000 people have shared this in the last 24 hours. Will you be next?"
- **Urgency:** "Share before this gets taken down" (censorship angle)

**Active Sharer → Content Creator:**
- **User-generated content campaigns:** "#RememberLuoxi Challenge: Post a photo of your child + 'This could have been [name]'"
- **Templates provided:** "Use this Instagram Story template [link] to create your own post"

**Slide 9:** "But 290,000 people are watching. And the number is growing."
**Slide 10:** "Remember her name: Luoxi. Share her story. #RememberLuoxi #JusticeForLuoxi"

**How to deploy:**
- Host templates on Canva (link shareable)
- Provide in Instagram-ready dimensions (1080x1920px)

**Tweet 2:**
"The hospital diagnosed a 7mm heart defect. The doctor said surgery was necessary. 99.5% success rate, he promised. It would take less than 3 hours, he said."

**Tweet 3:**
"The surgery took 6 hours—double the promised time. The family was told it was 'successful.' 30 minutes later, they were told the baby might not make it."

**Tweet 4:**
"At 10:03 PM, Luoxi was pronounced dead. She was 5 months old."

**Tweet 5:**
"This is Luoxi's grandmother, 7 days later, at 2:05 AM, feeding a bottle of breast milk to her granddaughter's empty clothes."

**Tweet 6:**
"The family demanded an autopsy. What they found changed everything."

**Tweet 7:**
"The autopsy revealed: NO 7mm defect existed. The diagnosis was false. Luoxi had only a 3mm hole—80% heal naturally within a year without surgery."

**Tweet 8:**
"Worse: A surgical patch was found INSIDE her heart. The hospital records said 'all patches removed.' That was a lie."

**Tweet 9:**
"Worse still: A 6.5cm chest wound was left UNSUTURED. The baby bled to death from wounds the doctors didn't close."

**Tweet 10:**
"The hospital offered the family $1,400 to stay quiet. The father said: 'We don't want money. We only want the truth.'"

**Tweet 11:**
"On December 20, the hospital posted a response to the autopsy. They deleted it within hours. Then 4 news articles about the case were censored and removed."

**Tweet 12:**
"But the mother went live on Chinese TikTok. She built 290,000 followers. People demanded answers."

**Tweet 13:**
"On December 22, the entire cardiac department was shut down. On December 23, the provincial government was forced to intervene."

**Tweet 14:**
"This story has gone viral in China. But there's been ZERO coverage in Western media. No NYT. No BBC. No CNN. Why?"

**Tweet 15:**
"Say her name: Luoxi (洛熙). Share her story. Don't let them erase her. #RememberLuoxi #JusticeForLuoxi"

- Pitch to medical trade publications

#### Community Moderation & Engagement Tactics

**Platform-Specific Moderation:**

**Instagram:**
- **Pin key comments:** Pin comment with petition link, website link, or key fact
- **Respond to questions:** First 50 comments get responses (algorithm boost)
- **Hide abusive comments:** Don't engage trolls, just hide
- **Story engagement:** Poll stickers ("Have you heard of this case? Yes/No"), question stickers ("What questions do you have?")

**TikTok:**
- **Reply to comments with videos:** Turn common questions into follow-up videos
- **Pin top comment:** Pin comment that directs to bio link or part 2
- **Duet/stitch user content:** Amplify supporters who make their own videos
- **Go live:** Q&A sessions, "What you want to know about this case"

**Twitter/X:**
- **Quote-tweet supporters:** Amplify good thread summaries with "Excellent breakdown by @[user]"
- **Respond to journalists:** Any journalist asking questions gets immediate, helpful response with sources
- **Mute, don't block:** Mute trolls (don't give them attention), block only if harassment
- **Threaded responses:** Important questions get threaded responses with sources

**Engagement KPIs to Track:**
- **Response rate:** % of comments/DMs responded to (Target: 50%+ in first 24hrs)
- **Engagement rate:** (Likes + Comments + Shares) / Followers (Target: 5-10% for viral content)
- **Share rate:** Shares / Views (Target: 3-5% for successful content)
- **Click-through rate:** Link clicks / Impressions (Target: 1-3% for petition/website)

### 2.2 Private Communities

#### Why Private Communities Matter

**Public platforms (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter):**
- ✅ Great for reach and virality
- ❌ Algorithmic control (platform can suppress)
- ❌ Passive engagement (scroll, like, scroll)
- ❌ No sustained organizing

**Private communities (Discord, Telegram, Facebook Groups):**
- ✅ Algorithm-free (you control distribution)
- ✅ Active engagement (discussion, coordination)
- ✅ Sustained organizing (long-term campaigns)
- ✅ Deeper relationships (community bonds)

**Strategy:** Use public platforms to BUILD audience, private communities to ORGANIZE audience.

#### Facebook Groups Strategy

**Group 1: Medical Malpractice Survivors & Families**

**Positioning:** Support group for people who've experienced medical malpractice (not just Luoxi)

**Why this works:**
- Emotional support need (people seek this out)
- Shared experiences (credibility, relatability)
- Luoxi case as example within broader issue
- Depoliticized (medical safety, not China-specific)

**How to launch:**
- Create group: "[Region] Medical Malpractice Support & Advocacy"
- Seed with 20-30 initial members (invite from public post comments)
- Post Luoxi story as "Member story highlight"
- Invite others to share their stories
- Weekly threads: "Share your story," "Ask a medical professional," "Resources & referrals"

**Growth tactics:**
- Facebook ad targeting: "Medical malpractice," "Hospital negligence," "Patient rights"
- Cross-post from public page: "Join our support group for deeper discussion [link]"
- Partner with patient advocacy orgs (cross-promote groups)

**Group 2: Parents for Medical Transparency**

**Positioning:** Advocacy group for parents demanding better hospital accountability

**Why this works:**
- Action-oriented (not just support, but advocacy)
- Parent identity (highly engaged demographic)
- Luoxi case as catalyst for systemic reform

**How to launch:**
- Create group: "Parents for Medical Transparency & Accountability"
- Mission: "Every parent deserves to know the truth about their child's medical care"
- Seed with parenting influencers who've covered case
- Weekly actions: Petition drives, email campaigns, social media shares

**Growth tactics:**
- Partner with parenting influencers (they invite their communities)
- Cross-promote with medical malpractice group
- Facebook ads targeting parents of young children

**Group 3: Luoxi Justice Campaign Organizing Hub**

**Positioning:** Private coordination group for active campaigners

**Why this works:**
- Central coordination (not scattered across platforms)
- Task delegation (who's doing what)
- Resource sharing (content kits, research, contacts)

**How to launch:**
- Create PRIVATE group (not public, not searchable)
- Invite only most engaged supporters (top 50-100)
- Roles: Moderators, translators, designers, outreach coordinators, researcher
- Weekly tasks: "This week's priorities," task assignments, progress updates

**Group Management:**
- Pin resources: Content kits, fact sheets, media contacts
- Weekly video update from organizers
- Celebrate wins: "This week's victories" thread
- Transparency: "Here's what we're working on"

#### Discord/Telegram for Coordinated Amplification

**Why Discord/Telegram vs. Facebook Groups:**
- **Real-time coordination** (instant messaging vs. threaded posts)
- **Better for global community** (time zones, international)
- **Less censorship risk** (Facebook groups can be taken down)
- **Tech-savvy younger audiences** (Gen Z/Millennial preference)

**Discord Server Structure:**

```
#welcome - Rules, mission, how to get involved
#announcements - Official updates only
#general - Open discussion
#content-sharing - Share posts, articles, videos about case
#translation-help - Chinese <> English translation requests
#design-requests - Need graphics, videos, etc.
#media-outreach - Coordinating journalist outreach
#action-alerts - "Post this now," "Share this thread," etc.
#wins - Celebrate progress
#resources - Fact sheets, press kit, content kits
Voice Channels:
- Weekly Community Call
- Working Groups (Translation, Design, Outreach)
```

**Telegram Group Strategy:**

**Public Channel (Broadcast Only):**
- Luoxi Case Updates (@RememberLuoxi or similar)
- 1-way communication (admin posts, followers receive)
- Daily/every-other-day updates
- Link to actions, petitions, content

**Private Group (Discussion):**
- Invite-only for active organizers
- Coordinate campaigns
- Share sensitive information (upcoming media, strategy)
- Real-time rapid response (if censorship escalates, family safety concerns)

**How to grow:**
- Instagram bio link: "Join our Telegram for daily updates"
- TikTok bio: "Link in bio for Telegram community"
- Twitter pinned: "Follow the campaign on Telegram [link]"

#### Sustained Engagement Tactics

**Weekly Content Calendar (Prevents Fatigue):**

**Monday:** Legal update (any court/investigation news)
**Tuesday:** Family update (mother's posts, father's updates)
**Wednesday:** #WednesdayWins (celebrate progress, no matter how small)
**Thursday:** Throwback (re-share key moments in case timeline)
**Friday:** Action Friday (petition drive, email campaign, social media push)
**Saturday:** Community spotlight (feature supporter's story, UGC highlight)
**Sunday:** Reflection Sunday (long-form content, deeper analysis)

**Special Days:**
- **14th of every month:** Luoxi remembrance posts (died Nov 14)
- **November 14 (annual):** Major remembrance event, anniversary vigil

**Preventing Burnout:**

**For followers:**
- ✅ Mix of heavy content (autopsy facts) and light content (community wins, hope)
- ✅ Clear actions (not just "be sad about this")
- ✅ Progress updates (show that effort is working)
- ✅ Breaks from intensity (not every post is about death, some about reform/hope)

**For organizers:**
- ✅ Rotate leadership (no one person does everything)
- ✅ Defined roles (translator, designer, outreach—not everyone does everything)
- ✅ Boundaries ("I can commit 5 hours/week" is OK)
- ✅ Celebrate small wins (don't wait for "full justice" to celebrate)

**Community Rituals:**

**Monthly Remembrance:**
- Every 14th, community posts #RememberLuoxi content
- Coordinated timing (everyone posts at same time for algorithm boost)
- Template provided (easy participation)

**Progress Check-Ins:**
- Monthly "State of the Campaign" video/post
- What we've achieved
- What we're working on next
- How people can help

**Milestone Celebrations:**
- Hit 100K petition signatures → Special thank-you video
- Major media pickup → "We did this together" post
- Policy discussion → "Our pressure is working" celebration

## 3. Cross-Platform Amplification

### 3.1 Content Reformatting Strategy

**Core Principle:** Create once, distribute many times.

**The Content Pyramid:**

```
           [1 Long-Form Video/Article]
                     ↓
           [3-5 Medium-Form Pieces]
                     ↓
         [10-15 Short-Form Clips/Posts]
                     ↓
        [20-30 Social Media Posts]
```

**Example:**

**Top (1 piece):** 15-minute YouTube documentary on Luoxi case

**Middle (5 pieces):**
- 3-min "Autopsy Revealed This" YouTube Short
- 3-min "Grandmother's Grief" TikTok
- 3-min "Censorship Timeline" Reel
- 5-min "Medical Ethics Breakdown" video
- 5-min "Mother's 290K Followers" story

**Bottom (15 clips):**
- 30-sec hook from beginning
- 30-sec autopsy reveal moment
- 30-sec grandmother photo + context
- 30-sec "hospital deleted statement"
- 30-sec "department shut down"
- (10 more clips, each highlighting a specific fact)

**Base (30 posts):**
- Quote graphics (father's "we want truth")
- Timeline graphics (Nov 14 - Dec 23)
- Fact cards ("Did you know...")
- Before/after photo posts
- Call-to-action graphics

#### Platform-Specific Optimization

**TikTok (60 sec max):**

**Format:**
- **0-3 sec:** Hook (text overlay question or shocking statement)
- **3-15 sec:** Setup (who, what, when)
- **15-45 sec:** Story (timeline, facts, emotion)
- **45-60 sec:** Resolution/CTA (what happened, what you can do)

**Optimization:**
- Text overlays (many watch without sound)
- Trending audio (if appropriate—be careful with somber content)
- Hashtags: 3-5 relevant (#JusticeForLuoxi #MedicalMalpractice #RememberLuoxi)
- Caption: First line must hook (rest gets cut off)

**Example TikTok (60 sec):**
- 0-3s: "A doctor promised 99.5% success. The baby died. Here's why." [Grandmother photo]
- 3-15s: "5-month-old Luoxi went in for heart surgery in China." [Baby photo]
- 15-30s: "The hospital said she had a 7mm defect. Life-threatening, they said." [Hospital exterior]
- 30-45s: "The autopsy revealed the truth: No such defect existed." [Autopsy document highlight]
- 45-55s: "This is her grandmother, feeding empty clothes at 2 AM." [Grandmother photo, linger]
- 55-60s: "Say her name: Luoxi. #RememberLuoxi" [Text overlay + photo]

**YouTube Shorts (60 sec max):**

**Same as TikTok EXCEPT:**
- More educational tone (YouTube audience expects depth)
- More SEO-focused title: "Baby Died from Unnecessary Surgery - Autopsy Proves Fraud"
- Description: Full links, timestamps, sources
- Pinned comment: Link to full 15-min video for more details

**Instagram Reels (90 sec max):**

**Same as TikTok EXCEPT:**
- Cleaner aesthetic (Instagram users expect higher production value)
- Use Instagram fonts/effects (platform-native feel)
- Link sticker to petition/website (if available)
- Carousel post as follow-up (swipeable fact cards)

**Instagram Carousel (10 slides max):**

**Format:**
- **Slide 1:** Hook image + text ("A baby died from surgery she didn't need")
- **Slides 2-8:** Story progression (one fact per slide, visual + text)
- **Slide 9:** Call to action ("Share this post")
- **Slide 10:** Resources (petition link, website, "Link in bio")

**Example Carousel:**
1. Luoxi smiling → "Her name was Luoxi. She was 5 months old."
2. Hospital exterior → "A hospital in China told her parents she needed heart surgery."
3. Medical imagery → "The doctor promised 99.5% success. It was a lie."
4. Grandmother photo → "This is her grandmother, 7 days later, at 2 AM."
5. Autopsy document → "The autopsy revealed: The diagnosis was false."
6. Before/after photo → "The surgery was unnecessary. Luoxi didn't need to die."
7. Text graphic → "'We don't want money. We only want the truth.' - Luoxi's father"
8. News headline collage → "China tried to delete this story. 4 articles censored."
9. Text overlay → "Share this post. Remember her name. #RememberLuoxi"
10. White background → "Learn more: [link in bio] Sign petition: [link in bio]"

**Twitter/X Thread:**

**See Content Kit 3 above (15-tweet thread template)**

**Additional optimization:**
- **Tweet 1 must be standalone** (many people only see first tweet)
- **Images on key tweets** (tweets 1, 5, 8, 15 minimum)
- **@mention journalists on final tweet** (but don't spam—be strategic)
- **Pin thread to profile** (if important)

**Facebook Post:**

**Format:**
- **Text:** Full story in post (Facebook prioritizes text)
- **Image:** Single powerful image (grandmother photo or before/after)
- **Link:** In comments (Facebook suppresses links in posts)

**Example Facebook Post:**

"This is Luoxi. She was 5 months old.

On November 14, 2025, a hospital in Ningbo, China, told her parents she needed immediate heart surgery. The doctor promised a 99.5% success rate. He said it was an "entry-level surgery" that would take less than 3 hours.

The surgery took over 6 hours. The baby died that same night.

When the family demanded answers, they got an autopsy. What it revealed was shocking:

- The 7mm heart defect the hospital diagnosed? It didn't exist.
- Luoxi had only a 3mm hole that 80% of babies heal from naturally.
- A surgical patch was found INSIDE her heart, even though records said "all patches removed."
- A 6.5cm chest wound was left UNSUTURED.

The hospital offered the family $1,400 to stay quiet. Luoxi's father said: "We don't want money. We only want the truth."

When the family published the autopsy findings, the hospital deleted their statement. Then 4 news articles about the case were censored.

But Luoxi's mother went live on Chinese social media. She built 290,000 followers. The grassroots pressure forced the provincial government to intervene. The entire cardiac department was shut down.

This story has gone viral in China, but there's been ZERO Western media coverage.

Say her name: Luoxi (洛熙).

Share her story.

### 3.3 Viral Loop Engineering

**What is a Viral Loop?**

A system where each user/viewer naturally brings in more users/viewers without additional effort from you.

**The Sharing Equation:**

```
Viral Coefficient = (% who share) × (avg. new viewers per share)

If Viral Coefficient > 1.0, content grows exponentially
If Viral Coefficient < 1.0, content plateaus
```

**Goal:** Engineer content to achieve viral coefficient >1.0

#### How to Create Content That Naturally Prompts Sharing

**Psychological Share Triggers:**

**1. Emotional intensity (anger, sadness, hope)**
- Grandmother feeding empty clothes → Unbearable sadness (HIGH share)
- Hospital lied, baby died → Outrage (HIGH share)
- Mother's 290K followers forced response → Hope/empowerment (MEDIUM share)

**Application:** Lead with emotional content, not just facts

**2. Identity expression ("This is what I believe")**
- Sharing = public statement of values
- "I share this because I care about medical accountability"
- "I share this because I'm a parent"

**Application:** Make sharing an identity statement
- "Parents, share this to protect our children"
- "Medical professionals, we need your voice on this"

**3. Social currency ("I'm in the know")**
- Sharing = showing you know something others don't
- "Have you heard about this?" "I just learned this shocking story"

**Application:** Frame as "what they don't want you to know"
- "This story has zero Western media coverage—share before it's buried"

**4. Practical value ("This helps people")**
- Sharing = helping others avoid danger or learn important information
- "Every parent should know this" "This could save a life"

**Application:** Frame as public service
- "Share this to warn other parents"
- "Share this to demand medical transparency"

**5. Story structure (beginning, middle, end)**
- Complete stories are more shareable than fragments
- People share narratives, not data points

**Application:** Even short content needs arc
- Setup: Happy baby
- Conflict: Hospital lied
- Resolution: Family fighting back (and we can help)

**Design Elements That Increase Sharing:**

**1. Clear Share CTA**
- ❌ No CTA = people don't know you want them to share
- ✅ "Share this to your story"
- ✅ "Tag 3 people who need to see this"
- ✅ "Share before this gets deleted"

**2. Easy to share (one tap)**
- ✅ Instagram: Native post (easy to share to story)
- ❌ External link (requires extra steps)

**3. Complete in itself (no "click link to learn more" required)**
- If story incomplete, people don't share (too much friction)
- Make content satisfying on its own, link is bonus

**4. Optimized for each platform's share mechanics**
- TikTok: Shareable to text messages, other apps
- Instagram: Shareable to story (most common)
- Twitter: Retweet is primary share mechanic
- Facebook: Share button (to timeline or group)

**Embedding CTAs That Drive Cross-Platform Follows:**

**Technique 1: Platform-Native CTAs**

**TikTok:**
- Pinned comment: "Follow for part 2" or "New to this story? Check my profile for full timeline"
- Voice CTA at end: "For daily updates, hit the follow button"

**Instagram:**
- End slide of Reel: "Follow @RememberLuoxi for updates"
- Pinned comment: "Link to petition and full story in bio—click our profile"

**Twitter:**
- Final tweet in thread: "Follow for updates as this case develops"
- Pinned tweet on profile: "New here? Start with this thread [link]"

**YouTube:**
- End screen: "Subscribe for updates on this case"
- Pinned comment: "If you want to help, here's how [links]"

**Technique 2: Cross-Platform Signaling**

**In TikTok video:**
- Text overlay: "Full documentary on YouTube—link in bio"
- Voice: "I break this down in detail on my Instagram—@RememberLuoxi"

**In Instagram post:**
- Caption: "I post daily updates on TikTok (@RememberLuoxi) and Twitter (@JusticeForLuoxi)"

**In YouTube video:**
- Description: "Follow on TikTok for short daily updates: @RememberLuoxi"

**Technique 3: Value Stacking**

Make each platform offer something unique:
- TikTok: Short daily updates, breaking news
- Instagram: Visual storytelling, comprehensive carousels
- Twitter: Real-time thread updates, journalist engagement
- YouTube: Long-form deep dives, documentary content
- Website: Full timeline, petition, all resources in one place

**CTA:** "Follow on all platforms for complete coverage—each platform has exclusive content"

```
Viral Coefficient = (Share Rate) × (Avg Viewers Per Share) × (Conversion Rate)

Example:
- Share rate: 3% (3 out of 100 viewers share)
- Avg viewers per share: 100 (each share reaches 100 new people)
- Conversion rate: 50% (50% of those viewers watch)

Viral Coefficient = 0.03 × 100 × 0.5 = 1.5

Since > 1.0, content will grow exponentially.
```

**Goal:** Viral coefficient >1.0 for key content

**Dashboard Tools:**

**Free:**
- Google Sheets (manual tracking)
- Platform native analytics
- Google Analytics (for website)

**Paid (if budget allows):**
- **Sprout Social** ($249/mo): Cross-platform analytics dashboard
- **Hootsuite** ($99/mo): Scheduling + analytics
- **Later** ($25/mo): Instagram/TikTok focused

**For this campaign (likely no budget):** Use free tools + manual weekly spreadsheet

## 4. Paid vs Organic Balance

### 4.1 When to Use Paid Promotion

**Scenario 1: Seeding Initial Content (First 24 Hours)**

**Why:**
- Algorithms favor content that gets early engagement
- Cold start problem: New account/content has zero momentum
- Small paid boost → triggers algorithm → organic reach

**How:**
- Boost best-performing post from Week 1 testing
- Budget: $50-200 for 24-hour boost
- Target: Broad audience (parents, medical interest, social justice)
- Goal: Get to 10K views → algorithm takes over organically

**Platforms:**
- Instagram: "Boost post" (easiest)
- TikTok: "Promote video" ($20 minimum)
- Facebook: "Boost post" ($10 minimum)
- Twitter: "Promote tweet" (skip—organic better on Twitter)

**ROI Metric:** Did organic reach continue after boost ended?
- ✅ Success: Boosted 24hrs, organic continued 48+ hours
- ❌ Failure: Boost ended, views dropped to zero

**Scenario 2: Targeting Specific Demographics**

**Why:**
- Organic reach is random; paid reach is targeted
- Want to reach specific groups: parents, medical professionals, journalists

**How:**
- Facebook/Instagram ads
- Targeting: Age 25-45, interests "parenting," "medical ethics," "social justice"
- Budget: $100-500/week during key campaign phases
- Goal: 100K targeted impressions

**Ad Creative:**
- Video: 30-sec version (grandmother photo, autopsy reveal)
- Caption: "This is every parent's nightmare. Here's what happened."
- CTA: "Learn more" (to website/petition)

**ROI Metric:** Cost per petition signature
- Target: <$2 per signature
- If higher: Organic is more cost-effective, stop paid

**Scenario 3: Retargeting Engaged Audiences**

**Why:**
- People who engaged once are likely to engage again
- Sustained campaign needs repeat exposure

**How:**
- Install Facebook Pixel on website
- Create "custom audience" of people who visited website
- Show them follow-up ads: "Here's what happened since you last checked"
- Budget: $50-200/week

**ROI Metric:** Follower conversion rate
- Target: 5-10% of retargeted audience becomes follower

**When NOT to Use Paid:**

❌ **Don't pay if organic is working**
- If content is already hitting 100K+ views organically, paid is waste of money

❌ **Don't pay on Twitter**
- Twitter's algorithm favors organic, paid ads underperform

❌ **Don't pay for low-quality content**
- Fix content first, boost later

❌ **Don't pay if conversion is low**
- If organic content gets views but no petition signatures, paid won't fix that

---

### 4.2 Organic Tactics Prioritization

**Which Platforms Reward Organic Reach Most:**

**Tier 1: TikTok (Best Organic Reach)**
- **Why:** Algorithm prioritizes content quality over follower count
- **Proof:** Accounts with 0 followers can get millions of views if content is good
- **Organic tactic:** Post 1-2x/day, use trending sounds, optimize hooks
- **Paid vs Organic:** 90% organic, 10% paid (only for seeding)

**Tier 2: Instagram (Good Organic, Declining)**
- **Why:** Algorithm still shows content to non-followers via Explore
- **Challenge:** Declining organic reach (Meta pushing paid)
- **Organic tactic:** Reels > Feed posts, use all features (stories, live, reels)
- **Paid vs Organic:** 70% organic, 30% paid (boost best content)

**Tier 3: YouTube (Long-Tail Organic)**
- **Why:** Search + suggested videos create long-term organic reach
- **Challenge:** Slower growth, but compounds over time
- **Organic tactic:** SEO optimization, consistent posting, engaging thumbnails
- **Paid vs Organic:** 95% organic, 5% paid (Google Ads if needed)

**Tier 4: Twitter/X (Organic Still Strong for News)**
- **Why:** Journalists and news flow happen organically
- **Challenge:** Reach limited to network unless goes viral
- **Organic tactic:** Threads, tag journalists, strategic timing
- **Paid vs Organic:** 95% organic, 5% paid (only for major campaigns)

**Tier 5: Facebook (Worst Organic, Heavy Paid)**
- **Why:** Meta severely limits organic reach (wants you to pay)
- **Challenge:** Posts often reach <5% of your followers organically
- **Organic tactic:** Groups (not pages), live video, engagement bait
- **Paid vs Organic:** 50/50 or skip Facebook entirely

**How to Maximize Organic Before Spending:**

**Step 1: Timing Optimization (FREE)**

**Best posting times by platform:**
- **TikTok:** 6-10 PM (after work/school), Tuesday-Thursday
- **Instagram:** 11 AM-1 PM (lunch scroll), Wednesday-Friday
- **Twitter:** 8-10 AM (morning scroll), 7-9 PM (evening scroll)
- **YouTube:** Weekend mornings (people watch longer content)

**Test your specific audience:** Post same content at different times, see what performs best

**Step 2: Hook Optimization (FREE)**

**A/B test hooks:**
- Version A: "A surgeon promised 99.5% success. The baby died."
- Version B: "This grandmother is feeding empty clothes at 2 AM. Let me explain."
- Version C: "China is deleting this story. Here's what they're hiding."

**Post all 3, see which gets most shares** (shares = best indicator of viral potential)

**Step 3: Engagement Velocity (FREE)**

**Algorithm favors fast early engagement:**

**Tactic:** Coordinate posting time with community
- Discord: "Posting in 5 minutes, everyone like/comment/share immediately"
- Goal: Get 100 engagements in first 10 minutes
- Result: Algorithm sees "hot content," pushes to more people

**Step 4: Cross-Promotion (FREE)**

**Use existing audiences:**
- Post on Instagram → Share to Instagram Story → Share to Facebook Story → Tweet the Instagram link
- Each platform feeds the others
- Cost: $0, just time

**Step 5: Influencer Partnerships (LOW/NO COST)**

**Micro-influencer collaborations:**
- Most will share for free if story resonates
- Some want $50-200 for dedicated post
- ROI: Way better than platform ads

**Comparison:**
- $200 Facebook ad = 50K impressions, 0 trust
- $200 micro-influencer = 20K followers, HIGH trust

**Use influencers before paid ads**

## 5. Growth Metrics & Measurement

### 5.1 Influencer ROI

**Metrics Per Collaboration:**

**For Micro-Influencers (10K-50K):**

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Reach per collaboration | Influencer's follower count × avg engagement rate | 3K-15K |
| Engagement rate | (Likes + Comments + Shares) / Reach | 5-8% |
| Conversion to followers | New followers gained / Reach | 1-3% |
| Cost per engagement | $ spent / Total engagements | $0.05-0.15 |

**Example:**
- Influencer: 30K followers, 6% engagement = 1,800 engagements
- Cost: $100
- Cost per engagement: $100 / 1,800 = $0.055 ✅ Good
- New followers: 50 (1.67% conversion) ✅ On target

**For Macro-Influencers (100K-500K):**

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Reach per collaboration | Follower count × 50-70% (IG) or 80-100% (TikTok) | 50K-500K |
| Engagement rate | (Likes + Comments + Shares) / Reach | 2-4% |
| Amplification multiplier | Secondary reach (shares × avg viewers) / Direct reach | 3-5x |
| Media pickup | Did journalists/other influencers notice? | Yes/No |

**Example:**
- Influencer: 200K followers, posts on Instagram
- Direct reach: 200K × 60% = 120K
- Engagement: 3% = 3,600 engagements
- Shares: 1% = 1,200 shares
- Secondary reach: 1,200 shares × 100 avg viewers = 120K
- Total reach: 240K (2x amplification) ✅ On target
- Media pickup: 2 journalists tweeted about it ✅ Bonus

**Tracking Spreadsheet Template:**

| Influencer | Followers | Platform | Post Date | Reach | Engagement | Shares | New Followers | Cost | ROI Notes |
|------------|-----------|----------|-----------|-------|------------|--------|---------------|------|-----------|
| @example1 | 25K | Instagram | Jan 20 | 15K | 900 (6%) | 450 | 30 | $0 | Organic, great ROI |
| @example2 | 150K | TikTok | Jan 22 | 200K | 6K (3%) | 4K | 100 | $500 | Paid, good reach |

**Red Flags (Poor ROI):**
- ❌ Engagement rate <2% (influencer has fake followers)
- ❌ No shares (content didn't resonate)
- ❌ No new followers (reach didn't convert)
- ❌ Cost per engagement >$0.50 (too expensive)

**What to do if ROI is poor:**
- Review influencer selection (are they right audience?)
- Review content quality (did story land emotionally?)
- Review CTA (was it clear what to do next?)

---

### 5.2 Community Health

**Metrics:**

**Active Member Percentage:**

```
Active Members = (Members who engaged in last 30 days) / (Total members)

Target: 20-40% for Discord/Telegram
Target: 5-15% for Facebook Group
```

**Example:**
- Discord: 500 members, 150 posted/reacted in last 30 days = 30% active ✅ Healthy
- Facebook Group: 2,000 members, 200 engaged last 30 days = 10% active ✅ On target

**User-Generated Content Volume:**

```
UGC Rate = (# of member-created posts about campaign) / (# of official posts)

Target: 2:1 ratio (2 UGC posts for every 1 official post)
```

**Example:**
- Official posts: 10 this week
- Member posts using #RememberLuoxi: 25 this week
- Ratio: 2.5:1 ✅ Excellent (community is self-sustaining)

**Sentiment Analysis (Manual Spot-Check):**

Sample 100 comments/posts per week, categorize:
- **Positive/Supportive:** "This is so important, thank you for sharing"
- **Neutral/Curious:** "Can someone explain what happened?"
- **Negative/Critical:** "This seems fake" or "Why should I care?"

**Target distribution:**
- 70%+ Positive
- 20-25% Neutral
- <10% Negative

**If negative >20%:** Address concerns, improve messaging, moderate trolls

**Community Health Dashboard (Weekly Check):**

| Metric | This Week | Last Week | Trend | Health |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|--------|
| Total members | 550 | 500 | ↑ | ✅ |
| Active % | 28% | 30% | ↓ | ⚠️ |
| UGC posts | 20 | 15 | ↑ | ✅ |
| UGC ratio | 2:1 | 1.5:1 | ↑ | ✅ |
| Sentiment (positive %) | 75% | 72% | ↑ | ✅ |

**Action based on health:**
- ✅ All green: Maintain current strategy
- ⚠️ Yellow warning: Post engagement prompt ("What questions do you have?")
- ❌ Red alert: Major intervention needed (live Q&A, new content series, address concerns)

---

### 5.3 Cross-Platform Efficiency

**Cost Per Follower by Platform:**

**Organic (no paid promotion):**

| Platform | Avg Cost Per Follower | Notes |
|----------|----------------------|-------|
| TikTok | $0 (organic only) | Best organic growth |
| Instagram | $0-1 (mostly organic) | Reels still work organically |
| Twitter | $0 (organic only) | News/journalist audience |
| YouTube | $0 (organic only) | Slow but compounding |
| Facebook | N/A | Don't focus on followers, use groups |

**With Paid Promotion:**

| Platform | Avg Cost Per Follower | When Worth It |
|----------|----------------------|---------------|
| Instagram | $0.50-2 | If targeting specific demo |
| TikTok | $0.30-1 | If seeding new account |
| Facebook | $1-3 | Usually not worth it |
| YouTube | $2-5 | Only for long-tail content |

**Target:** Keep cost per follower under $1 with paid, $0 with organic

**Amplification Multiplier by Platform:**

```
Amplification Multiplier = Total Reach / Follower Count

Measures how effectively content reaches beyond existing followers
```

**Benchmarks:**

| Platform | Typical Multiplier | Viral Content Multiplier |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| TikTok | 10-50x | 100-1000x+ |
| Instagram | 2-5x | 10-50x |
| Twitter | 1-3x | 10-100x |
| YouTube | 5-20x (due to search/suggested) | 50-500x |

**Example:**
- Instagram account: 5,000 followers
- Reel reach: 25,000 views
- Amplification: 5x ✅ Good organic reach beyond followers

**If multiplier is low (<1.5x):**
- Content isn't resonating (not being shared)
- Shadowban or algorithm suppression
- Need to improve hooks, CTAs, content quality

---

### 5.4 Viral Coefficient

**Definition:**

```
Viral Coefficient (K) = (Invite Rate) × (Conversion Rate)

Where:
- Invite Rate = % of users who share
- Conversion Rate = % of people who see share and engage

If K > 1: Exponential growth (each user brings >1 new user)
If K < 1: Plateau (growth depends on external input)
```

**How to Calculate:**

**Step 1: Measure Invite Rate**
- 1,000 people saw content
- 30 shared it
- Invite rate = 30 / 1,000 = 3%

**Step 2: Measure Reach Per Share**
- Each share reached avg 100 people

**Step 3: Measure Conversion Rate**
- 3,000 people reached via shares (30 shares × 100 reach)
- 60 engaged (watched, liked, or followed)
- Conversion rate = 60 / 3,000 = 2%

**Step 4: Calculate K**
```
K = 0.03 (invite rate) × 100 (reach per invite) × 0.02 (conversion)
K = 0.06 × 2 = 0.06

K = 0.06 (below 1, will plateau)
```

**To improve K:**
- ✅ Increase invite rate: Better share CTAs, more emotional content
- ✅ Increase reach per invite: Optimize for platforms with high share reach (TikTok)
- ✅ Increase conversion: Better hooks, clearer story

**Target Viral Coefficient by Content Type:**

| Content Type | Target K | Notes |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| Emotional core content (grandmother photo) | >1.5 | Should go viral |
| Fact-based content (autopsy findings) | 0.8-1.2 | Solid but not explosive |
| Action-oriented (petitions, CTAs) | 0.5-0.8 | Lower virality but high conversion |

**How Many New Viewers Each Existing Viewer Brings:**

**Formula:**
```
New Viewers Per Viewer = (Shares / Views) × (Avg Reach Per Share)
```

**Example:**
- Video: 10,000 views
- Shares: 300 (3% share rate)
- Avg reach per share: 150 people

```
New Viewers Per Viewer = (300 / 10,000) × 150 = 0.03 × 150 = 4.5 new viewers per viewer
```

**Interpretation:**
- Every person who watches brings 4.5 new viewers
- K = 4.5 (way above 1) ✅ This content will explode

**Target:** Aim for K > 1.0 for key content, K > 2.0 for breakthrough content

- ❌ <5K petition signatures → CTA not working, improve conversion funnel

**Month 2:**
- ❌ <2M total reach → Stalled growth, need macro-influencer breakthrough
- ❌ Zero mainstream media → Need PR push, journalist outreach intensification

**Month 3:**
- ❌ <5M total reach → Campaign failing, major strategic rethink needed

## Conclusion

This growth hacking strategy transforms the Luoxi case from strong organic potential (grandmother photo 65/70 viral score, autopsy proof, 290K Chinese followers) into a sustained global movement through systematic multi-channel outreach, organic algorithm optimization, and community activation.

**V2 Update: Zero-Contact Reality Edition**

This document has been updated to reflect the CEO constraint: "I don't know any influencers of any size." The revised strategy (V2) prioritizes growth mechanisms that DON'T depend on influencer relationships:

1. **Organic Algorithm First:** TikTok FYP, Instagram Explore, Reddit front page can deliver 100K-1M+ reach without any influencer partnerships
2. **Journalists Over Influencers:** 10-15% cold response rate vs. 2-5% for influencers, plus each article = 10-100x more credibility
3. **Paid Amplification:** $100-500 can reach 100K+ people without relationship-building
4. **Community Amplification:** 500 engaged members sharing weekly = more reach than 1 macro-influencer post
5. **Volume Approach:** Contact 200-300 influencers (not 50) to compensate for 2-5% cold response rate

**Three Keys to Success (V2):**

1. **Organic + Paid > Influencers:** Don't wait for influencer partnerships to start growing. Post 5-10 TikToks, 5-10 Reels, 5-10 Reddit posts. If 1-2 hit the algorithm, you've achieved Week 1 goals without a single influencer.

2. **Journalists Are Your Primary Target:** Responding to pitches is their job. 50 journalist contacts → 5-10 responses → 2-3 articles = more valuable than 10 micro-influencer posts. Prioritize journalist outreach over influencer outreach.

3. **Community = Sustainability:** 500 engaged Discord/Facebook/Telegram members who share weekly generate 150K-450K organic reach. Build community from Day 1—they become your unpaid amplifiers.

**Expected Outcomes (90 days) - V2 Reality:**
- **Conservative:** 3M reach, 10K signatures, 500 active community, 1-2 journalist articles
- **Target:** 5M reach, 25K signatures, 1K-3K active community, 3-5 journalist articles, 3-5 influencer partnerships
- **Optimistic:** 10M+ reach, 50K+ signatures, 5K+ active community, 5-10 journalist articles, mainstream media breakthrough

**Reality Check:**
- If you get ZERO influencer partnerships in Month 1, the strategy can still succeed via organic reach + journalist articles + community amplification
- If you DO get influencer partnerships, that's a bonus accelerator on top of the baseline organic/journalist growth

The window is now. Zero Western coverage means first-mover advantage. Censorship will escalate, but international pressure provides family protection. Execute this playbook in next 30 days to maximize breakthrough potential.

**Next Step:** CEO reviews, prioritizes Week 1 actions (journalist outreach + organic algorithm seeding FIRST, influencer outreach SECOND), coordinates with M3.1 (Content Production) to produce Value-First Content Kit and journalist press kit.
