---

Hi [Name],

I've been following your reporting on [specific STAT News article they wrote on medical safety/ethics].

I'm documenting a case in China where a 5-month-old baby died from heart surgery. The autopsy revealed the hospital misdiagnosed the condition—the defect that required "urgent" surgery didn't exist. The surgeon promised 99.5% success.

Zero Western media coverage yet, despite 290K Chinese followers and provincial government intervention. The hospital closed its entire cardiac surgery department after the family went public.

I have a fact sheet, timeline, autopsy excerpts (translated), and high-res photos ready if you'd like to take a look. No pressure—just thought it might fit your beat on medical accountability.

Hi [Name],

I've been following your investigations into [specific ProPublica piece they wrote on healthcare failures].

- Grassroots resistance (mother built 290,000 followers, forced provincial intervention)

Hi [Name],

I've been following your analysis on [specific Diplomat piece on China healthcare/governance].

I'm documenting a case that might fit The Diplomat's long-form format: A Chinese hospital performed unnecessary heart surgery on a 5-month-old baby. The baby died. The autopsy contradicted the hospital's diagnosis.

The systemic angle:
- Hospital closed entire cardiac surgery department (rare for major hospital)
- Provincial government intervened (indicates higher-level concern)
- Grassroots resistance (family built 290,000 followers despite censorship)
- Medical records discrepancies (patch left inside heart, wounds unsutured)

This speaks to larger issues in Chinese healthcare governance: accountability, patient rights, local vs. provincial authority dynamics.

I have a complete fact sheet if you'd like to explore this as an analysis piece.

Hi [Name],

I saw your work on [specific bioethics article on informed consent/medical malpractice].

I'm documenting a case that raises significant bioethics questions: A Chinese hospital performed heart surgery on a 5-month-old baby, promising 99.5% success. The baby died. The autopsy revealed the diagnosis requiring surgery didn't exist.

Bioethics angles:
- Informed consent (family was told surgery was urgent, autopsy shows it wasn't)
- Unnecessary procedures (medical records vs. autopsy discrepancies)
- International medical standards (Chinese vs. Western ASD repair guidelines)
- Patient advocacy in authoritarian context (family built 290K followers despite censorship)

Would this be appropriate for a Hastings Center case analysis? I have complete documentation including autopsy excerpts and medical expert analysis.

---

Hi [Name],

I've been listening to [specific podcast episode on medical malpractice/ethics].

I have a case that might work well for your show: A 5-month-old baby in China died from heart surgery. The surgeon promised 99.5% success. The autopsy revealed the surgery was unnecessary—the diagnosis was false.

The story has layers:
- Medical: Autopsy contradicts hospital diagnosis (ASD misdiagnosis)
- Ethics: Informed consent violation (family told "urgent," autopsy says "not needed")
- Cultural: Chinese healthcare system context (hospital closed entire dept, rare)
- Human: Grandmother's photo feeding empty bottle to baby's clothes (290K viral)

This could be a 30-45 min episode exploring: What happens when hospitals make fatal diagnosis errors? How do families seek accountability in authoritarian systems?

I have all materials (fact sheet, autopsy excerpts, medical expert analysis, family's social media). Would this fit your show?

---

## Email Personalization Checklist

**Before sending each email (15-20 min per journalist):**

1. **Find specific article they wrote:**
   - Google: "[journalist name] [beat keyword]"
   - Read 1-2 recent articles to understand their beat

2. **Personalize first paragraph:**
   - "I've been following your reporting on [specific article title]"
   - Reference specific angle/theme from their work

3. **Match your pitch to their beat:**
   - Medical ethics reporter → Emphasize informed consent violation
   - China correspondent → Emphasize censorship + grassroots resistance
   - Investigative journalist → Emphasize documentary proof + systemic issues

4. **Customize call-to-action:**
   - For academics: "Would this be appropriate for a case analysis?"
   - For breaking news reporters: "This is still breaking—family posting daily"
   - For freelancers: "Would you consider pitching this to [outlet you know they write for]?"

**Do NOT:**
- ❌ Send generic copy-paste emails
- ❌ Use "Dear Sir/Madam" or "To Whom It May Concern"
- ❌ Pitch to journalists whose beat clearly doesn't match (e.g., sports reporter)
- ❌ Follow up more than 3 times (spam = instant ignore)
- ❌ Use attachments in first email (fact sheet = Google Doc link only)

---

## Expected Outcomes

**Week 1 (10 emails sent):**
- 0-2 responses (10-15% response rate is realistic)
- 0-1 "interested, send materials" (most responses will be "thanks, not my beat")
- 0 articles published (too soon)

**Week 2 (Day 7 follow-ups):**
- 1-3 total responses (follow-ups increase response rate 30-50%)
- 0-2 "send materials"
- 0 articles published (journalists need 1-3 weeks to write)

**Week 3-4 (Day 14 follow-ups):**
- 1-3 total responses (diminishing returns after Day 14)
- 0-2 journalists actively working on article
- 0-1 article published (optimistic: Week 4, realistic: Week 6-8)

**Month 2-3:**
- 1-2 articles published (regional/niche outlets)
- 0-1 mainstream outlet pickup (if regional article goes viral)

**Reality Check:**
- **0 responses out of 10 = statistically normal** (10% base rate)
- **0 articles published by Week 8 = time to pivot** (increase volume to 30+ journalists, try freelancers)
- **1 article published = MISSION SUCCESS** (unblocks Wikipedia submission, creates credibility for future outreach)

---

## Backup Plan (If 0 Responses by Week 3)

**If 0/10 journalists respond after 3 follow-ups:**

**Option 1: Increase Volume (Week 4)**
- Research 20 more journalists (freelancers, regional outlets, medical journals)
- Send 20 emails Week 4
- Expected: 2-4 responses

**Option 2: Try Medical Journals (Week 4)**
- Target: The Lancet, BMJ, JAMA (case report editors)
- Angle: "Case report submission opportunity"
- Lower journalistic value but academic credibility

**Option 3: Pivot to Reddit Organic (Week 4)**
- If Reddit post hits 1K+ upvotes, journalists may email YOU
- Monitor Reddit DMs and post comments for journalist inquiries

**Option 4: Paid PR Distribution (Month 2)**
- Services: PRWeb, Newswire (cost: $100-200)
- Distributes press release to journalist databases
- Lower quality responses but reaches more journalists

**Option 5: Accept Longer Timeline (Month 2-3)**
- Some journalists take 4-8 weeks to respond
- Continue monitoring inbox
- Focus on TikTok/Reddit organic growth in parallel

---

## Success Criteria

**Mission is SUCCESSFUL if ANY of these happen:**

1. **1 journalist responds asking for materials** (Week 1-3)
   - Even if they don't publish, this validates the pitch is working
   - Refine pitch based on their questions, send to 10 more journalists

2. **1 journalist article published** (Week 4-8)
   - Regional outlet (SCMP, The Diplomat) = SUCCESS
   - Niche outlet (STAT, medical journal) = SUCCESS
   - Mainstream outlet (NYT, Guardian, NPR) = EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS

3. **1 journalist article → Wikipedia submission unblocked** (Week 6-10)
   - Wikipedia needs 2-3 independent sources
   - 1 Western journalist article + 2 Chinese sources (The Paper, China Daily) = sufficient
   - Submit Wikipedia V2 article with journalist article as Tier 1 citation

**If ALL journalists ignore (0 responses by Week 8):**
- Mission is NOT failed
- Pivot to zh.wikipedia (Chinese Wikipedia) with 68 domestic sources
- Continue TikTok/Reddit organic growth
- Wikipedia submission delayed to Month 4-6 (wait for legal case resolution or anniversary coverage)

---

## Journalist Outreach is HIGHEST ROI Activity Week 1

**Why prioritize journalists over influencers:**
- ✅ 10-15% response rate (vs. 2-5% for influencers)
- ✅ Each article = 10-100x more credibility than influencer post
- ✅ Articles are permanent, SEO-optimized, cited by others
- ✅ Articles unblock Wikipedia submission (need 2-3 independent sources)
- ✅ Articles generate secondary media coverage (other journalists cite them)
- ✅ Articles legitimize the story (families can reference "as reported in [outlet]")

**ROI calculation:**
- 5 hours Week 1 (research + emails) → 1-2 responses → 0-1 article (Week 4-8) → 100K-500K article readership + Wikipedia unblocked + ongoing credibility
- vs. 5 hours influencer outreach → 0-1 responses → 0-1 post (ephemeral, entertainment) → 10K-50K views, no credibility

**Journalist outreach = 10x ROI compared to influencer outreach.**

---

**Files Needed for Journalist Outreach:**
1. **work/viral-mechanics/journalist-targets.md** (this file) - Research guide
2. **Fact sheet** (Google Doc) - 1-page summary to send journalists
3. **Tracking spreadsheet** (Google Sheets) - Monitor responses, follow-ups
4. **Gmail labels** - Organize journalist emails for Day 7/Day 14 follow-ups

**Next Steps:**
1. Create fact sheet (Google Doc) - Monday (2-3 hours)
2. Research 10 journalists - Monday (3-4 hours)
3. Send 10 emails - Tuesday AM (2-3 hours)
4. Follow up Day 7 - Following Tuesday (30 min)
5. Follow up Day 14 - Week 3 Monday (30 min)

**Execute now.**
