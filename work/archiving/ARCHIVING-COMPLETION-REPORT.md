## Integration with Existing Intelligence

### Cross-Referenced Documents

**1. work/intelligence/media-inventory.md**
- **What it contains:** Catalog of 50 existing media files (40 media + 10 source docs)
- **How I used it:** Identified what's already archived vs. what's missing
- **My contribution:** Priority list notes which images are video screenshots (find original videos on Douyin)
- **Example:** V005 "Grandmother feeding empty clothes" - image archived but ORIGINAL VIDEO must be found on Douyin

**2. work/intelligence/sources/platform-censorship-analysis.md**
- **What it contains:** Detailed analysis of censorship tactics by platform
- **How I used it:** Justification for 24-48hr urgency, Douyin permissiveness analysis
- **My contribution:** Translated censorship intelligence into actionable archiving timeline
- **Key insight:** Douyin shows LOW-MODERATE censorship (family has 292K followers, live streams allowed) BUT this could change instantly

**3. work/intelligence/sources/high-value-content/PRESERVATION-PRIORITIES.md**
- **What it contains:** Broader preservation priorities (Douyin + Weibo + Zhihu + articles)
- **How I used it:** Confirmed Douyin as CRITICAL priority, noted secondary targets
- **My contribution:** Focused specifically on executable Douyin archiving (scoped to what one human can do in 24-48hrs)
- **Alignment:** My "HIGH priority" videos match their "CRITICAL - preserve immediately" category

**4. work/intelligence/consolidated-timeline.md**
- **What it contains:** Complete timeline of Luoxi case from birth to present
- **How I used it:** Identified key dates for video searching (Nov 11-15, Dec 19, Jan 6-7)

**5. work/intelligence/key-facts.md + verified-claims.md**
- **What it contains:** Core facts and verified claims about the case
- **How I used it:** Ensured archiving priorities align with evidentiary needs
- **My contribution:** Prioritized videos containing evidence (autopsy discussion, hospital confrontation, surgery timeline)

## What Makes This Archiving Plan Unique

### Compared to Existing Preservation Priorities Document

**PRESERVATION-PRIORITIES.md (Intelligence Team):**
- Scope: BROAD (Douyin + Weibo + Zhihu + celebrity posts + articles + hospital statements)
- Audience: General preservation awareness
- Detail: What to preserve, why it matters
- Actionability: MODERATE (lists priorities but not step-by-step)

**My Archiving Deliverables:**
- Scope: NARROW (Douyin family accounts ONLY)
- Audience: Non-technical human worker executing archiving
- Detail: HOW to preserve, with exact tools/commands/troubleshooting
- Actionability: COMPLETE (can hand to human, they can execute immediately)

**Complementary Relationship:**
- Intelligence team identified WHAT needs preserving across all platforms
- I created EXECUTABLE PLAN for most urgent target (Douyin, 24-48hr window)
- Future: Similar plans could be created for Weibo/Zhihu (lower urgency)

### Key Differentiators

**1. Tool Selection with Backup Plans**
- Primary: Douyin Downloader (batch, metadata, efficiency)
- Backup: 4K Video Downloader (GUI, non-technical)
- Tertiary: Web tools (emergency)
- **Why:** Ensures success regardless of technical skill level or tool failure

**2. Prioritization System**
- Not just "high/medium/low" but SPECIFIC VIDEOS identified
- Decision tree: "If you have 1 hour, download THESE 5 videos"
- **Why:** Maximizes value if time runs out or censorship strikes mid-operation

**3. Quality Assurance**
- Verification steps (play random videos, check file sizes)
- Metadata standards (minimum vs. target vs. ideal)
- Failure thresholds (if >5% corrupted, stop and diagnose)
- **Why:** Ensures archive is usable, not just downloaded

**4. Troubleshooting**
- 10+ specific error scenarios with solutions
- "Issue → Error message → Solution" format
- VPN issues, download speed, account access, storage, tool failures
- **Why:** Prevents worker from getting stuck and abandoning operation

**5. Redundancy & Backup**
- Multiple cloud services (Google Drive + Dropbox + iCloud)
- External hard drive
- Different jurisdictions (US vs. China legal pressure)
- **Why:** Content protected even if one backup deleted under legal pressure

## Risk Assessment

### Risks to Archiving Operation

| Risk | My Mitigation |
|------|---------------|
| **Tools too technical** | 3 tool options (Python + GUI + web), detailed installation guides |
| **Human gets stuck** | 10+ troubleshooting scenarios, CEO support mechanism |
| **Account deleted before start** | Recovery plan (search re-posts, secondary platforms, contact family) |
| **Downloads too slow** | Overnight batch processing, priority system (high-value first) |
| **VPN required but unavailable** | VPN recommendations (ExpressVPN, Astrill), testing step |
| **Storage space insufficient** | Pre-check step (15GB), external drive option |
| **Censorship during operation** | HIGH priority videos first (25 videos in first 4 hours) |
| **Metadata logging too tedious** | Minimum viable approach (filename + URL + date ONLY if time short) |
| **Cloud backup blocked** | Multiple services (3+ backup locations), external drive |

### Current Status of Target Content

**Last Verified:** Intelligence reports reference December 2025 data
**Account Status:** Assumed ACTIVE (292K followers as of inventory)
**Content Status:** Autopsy published Dec 19, live stream Jan 6 → account recently active

**⚠️ CRITICAL: CEO must verify account STILL ACTIVE before starting archiving**

**Verification command (in instructions.md):**
1. Visit https://www.douyin.com (or search "小洛熙妈妈")
2. Check follower count (should be ~292K)
3. Check most recent post date (should be within 1 week)
4. If account suspended/deleted → ACTIVATE RECOVERY PLAN immediately

---

## Recommendations for CEO

### Immediate Next Steps (Hour 0-1)

**1. Verify Target Account Status (15 min)**
- Check if @小洛熙妈妈 still accessible
- Note follower count (if dropped >20%, account may be restricted)
- Check last post date (if no posts in 7+ days, may indicate pressure)

**2. Assign Human Worker (30 min)**
- Someone with basic computer skills
- 3-4 hours active time available
- Overnight availability (batch downloads)
- Access to VPN if outside China

**3. Prepare Resources (15 min)**
- Ensure computer has 15GB free space
- VPN account ready (if needed)
- Excel or Google Sheets available
- Video player installed (VLC recommended)

### Decision Framework

**IF account is ACTIVE and accessible:**
→ **GREEN LIGHT: Start archiving within 24 hours**
- Risk: LOW-MODERATE
- Expected outcome: 70-200 videos archived, 5-10GB
- Worker hands instructions.md, executes 5-step workflow

**IF account shows signs of restriction:**
→ **YELLOW LIGHT: Start IMMEDIATELY (within 6 hours)**
- Signs: Follower count dropping, videos being removed, no recent posts
- Risk: MODERATE-HIGH
- Strategy: HIGH priority videos ONLY (25 videos, 4 hours)
- Archive what's accessible before total lockdown

**IF account is already DELETED:**
→ **RED LIGHT: Activate recovery plan**
- See instructions.md "Recovery Plan (If Content Already Deleted)"
- Search for re-posts on Douyin, Weibo, Xiaohongshu
- Check overseas platforms (Facebook, YouTube)
- Contact family directly (CEO APPROVAL REQUIRED FIRST)

### Post-Archiving Actions (Hour 48+)

**1. Integrate Archive into Media Inventory**
- Update work/intelligence/media-inventory.md
- Add Douyin archive section with:
  - Total videos archived
  - Date range covered
  - Follower count at time of archive
  - Any censored content documented

**2. Brief Content Teams**
- Production team: High-priority assets available for video editing
- Translation team: Video descriptions need Chinese → English
- Outreach team: Archive available for media distribution

**3. Monitor for Censorship**
- Daily check of Douyin accounts for new content or deletion
- If account deleted POST-archiving → document as censorship evidence
- Update platform-censorship-analysis.md with findings

**4. Consider Secondary Platform Archiving**
- After Douyin secure, assess if Weibo/Zhihu archiving warranted
- Father's Weibo (@小洛熙爸爸唯一号) also at risk
- Zhihu medical threads valuable but lower deletion risk
- Can use similar methodology (create separate archiving plan)

---

## Lessons Learned (To Be Updated Post-Execution)

**Pre-Operation Observations:**

**What Worked Well in Planning:**
- Cross-referencing existing intelligence (media inventory, censorship analysis, preservation priorities)
- Scoping narrowly to ONE urgent target (Douyin only)
- Providing multiple tool options (accommodates different skill levels)
- Including extensive troubleshooting (anticipates worker getting stuck)

**What Could Be Improved:**
- No direct access to verify Douyin account status (relying on intelligence reports from Dec 2025)
- Cannot test download tools myself (providing instructions without firsthand validation)
- Timeline estimates based on assumptions (actual download speed may vary)

**Assumptions Made (To Be Validated):**
1. Account @小洛熙妈妈 still exists and is accessible
2. Worker has basic computer literacy (can install software, follow instructions)
3. VPN available if needed (ExpressVPN/Astrill accessible in worker's location)
4. Download speeds 2-5 Mbps typical (China VPN bandwidth)
5. Video count 50-200 total (based on "active posting" assumption)

**Post-Execution Section (To Be Filled):**
- [ ] What actually happened during archiving
- [ ] Which tools worked/failed
- [ ] How long it really took
- [ ] What unexpected issues arose
- [ ] Final archive statistics (videos, size, completion %)
- [ ] Recommendations for future archiving operations
