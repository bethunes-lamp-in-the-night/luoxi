## The 1-Minute Version

**Problem:** Family Douyin account (292K followers) at risk of censorship within 24-48 hours

**Solution:** Archive all videos before deletion

**What I created:** Complete archiving manual for non-technical human worker

**What you do:** Assign someone → Tell them to read `instructions.md` → They execute

**Time:** 12-20 hours total (mostly overnight unattended downloads)

**Result:** 70-200 videos (5-10GB) preserved forever, multiple backups

**Why urgent:** Other platforms already censoring (Xiaohongshu, WeChat), Douyin could be next

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Account Status | Action | Timeline |
|----------------|--------|----------|
| ✅ Active, recent posts | Start within 24hrs | LOW risk |
| ⚠️ Active but warning signs | Start within 6hrs | MEDIUM risk |
| 🚫 Deleted/suspended | Recovery plan NOW | CRITICAL |

**Warning Signs:**
- Follower count dropped >20%
- Videos being removed (gaps in timeline)

## The Bottom Line

**6 files, 14,581 words, 112KB of documentation**

**Everything a human needs to archive the family's Douyin content before censorship.**

**All you need to do: Assign someone and say "start."**

**Every hour delayed = higher risk of total loss.**

## Questions?

**"How long will this take?"**
→ 12-20 hours total, 6-8 hours human active time

**"Do they need to speak Chinese?"**
→ No - URLs and video files are universal

**"What if the tools don't work?"**
→ 3 backup options provided in instructions.md

**"What if account is already deleted?"**
→ Recovery plan in instructions.md (search re-posts, secondary platforms)

**"Is this legal?"**
→ Yes - archiving publicly posted content for research/documentary

**"What if family doesn't want this?"**
→ Family WANTS visibility (292K followers = public advocacy), but will respect if they request removal

**"Could this endanger the family?"**
→ No - they're already public and under scrutiny, archiving doesn't increase risk

**"What do we do with the archive after?"**
→ Use for content production, media outreach, legal evidence, historical record
