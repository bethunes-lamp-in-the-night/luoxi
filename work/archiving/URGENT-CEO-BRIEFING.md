## Situation

**Family Douyin account (@小洛熙妈妈, 292K followers) at imminent risk of censorship/deletion.**

- Other platforms already censoring (Xiaohongshu suppressed, WeChat deleted articles within 24hrs)
- Douyin currently permissive but this could end ANY MOMENT
- Account contains 2+ months of family advocacy, evidence, viral content
- If deleted before archiving: Content GONE FOREVER

**Window:** 24-48 hours before HIGH risk

## What You Need to Do RIGHT NOW

### 1. Assign Human Worker (TODAY)
**Requirements:**
- Basic computer skills
- Can follow detailed instructions
- 3-4 hours active time + overnight availability
- Access to VPN (if outside China)

**NOT Required:**
- Technical expertise
- Chinese language skills
- Video editing knowledge

### 2. Verify Account Status (NEXT 1 HOUR)
- Check if @小洛熙妈妈 still accessible
- Note current follower count (baseline: 292K - if dropped significantly, account may be restricted)
- Verify most recent post (if no new posts in 3+ days, may indicate pressure)

### 3. Provide Resources (TODAY)
- Computer with 15GB free space
- VPN service (if outside China): ExpressVPN or Astrill
- Access to archiving folder

### 4. Give Green Light to Start (WITHIN 24 HOURS)
Tell worker: "Read instructions.md, start immediately, download HIGH priority first"

---

## Expected Outcome

**Best Case (Started within 24hrs):**
- 70-200 videos archived (5-10GB)
- Complete family narrative preserved
- Evidence secured before censorship
- Multiple cloud backups created

**Worst Case (Delayed or account already deleted):**
- Partial archive only
- Some evidence lost
- Activate recovery plan (search for re-posts, secondary platforms)

---

## Timeline

**Hour 0-1:** You assign worker, verify account status
**Hour 1-2:** Worker reads instructions, sets up tools
**Hour 2-4:** Worker archives profiles, collects video URLs, starts batch downloads
**Hour 4-12:** Batch downloads run overnight (unattended)
**Hour 12-16:** Worker logs metadata, archives comments, verifies quality
**Hour 16-20:** Cloud backup uploads
**Hour 20:** Worker reports completion to you

**Total:** 12-20 hours elapsed, 6-8 hours human active time

---

## Success Metrics

**Minimum (Mission Success):**
- 25+ HIGH priority videos downloaded
- Account profiles documented
- One backup created

**Target (Strong Success):**
- 80%+ of all videos downloaded
- Detailed metadata logged
- Multiple backups

**Ideal (Perfect Success):**
- 100% of content downloaded
- Comments archived
- 3+ backup locations

---

## Why This Matters

**If we archive:**
✅ Family's story preserved regardless of censorship
✅ Evidence secure for legal/advocacy use
✅ Content available for Western campaign
✅ Censorship exposed if deletion occurs

**If we DON'T archive:**
❌ One censorship directive = 292K follower account GONE
❌ 2 months of family documentation ERASED
❌ Evidence LOST
❌ Censorship SUCCEEDS

---

## Your Decision

**Option 1: START IMMEDIATELY (Recommended)**
- Assign worker today
- Begin archiving within 24 hours
- Complete before censorship window closes
- **Risk: LOW** (probably safe for 24-48hrs)

**Option 2: DELAY 48+ HOURS**
- Wait for "better time" or "more resources"
- **Risk: MEDIUM-HIGH** (censorship probability increases)
- May lose partial or complete access to content

**Option 3: DO NOTHING**
- Hope Douyin stays permissive
- **Risk: CRITICAL** (if account deleted, content gone forever)
- No recovery possible

---

## My Recommendation

**START WITHIN 24 HOURS.**

Rationale:
1. Censorship patterns show rapid escalation (24hr article deletions)
2. Douyin permissive NOW, no guarantee for tomorrow
3. Archive operation is LOW RISK (downloading public content)
4. Time investment modest (6-8 hours human time)
5. Downside of NOT archiving is CATASTROPHIC (total loss)
6. Downside of archiving is MINIMAL (storage space, worker time)

**Risk-reward ratio heavily favors immediate action.**

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **You:** Read `${PROJECT_ROOT}/work/archiving/README.md` (5 min)
2. ✅ **You:** Assign human worker (today)
3. ✅ **You:** Verify @小洛熙妈妈 account status (1 hour)
4. ✅ **Worker:** Read instructions.md (20 min)
5. ✅ **Worker:** Execute archiving operation (12-20 hours)
6. ✅ **Worker:** Report completion to you
7. ✅ **You:** Verify archive, brief teams, plan content use

## The Bottom Line

**We have a 24-48 hour window to preserve 2 months of the family's public advocacy before potential censorship.**

**The tools are ready. The instructions are complete. The priority list is clear.**

**All you need to do: Assign a human and say "start now."**

**Every hour of delay increases risk of total loss.**
