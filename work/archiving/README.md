## Why This Is Urgent

### Censorship Pattern Analysis

Based on intelligence from `platform-censorship-analysis.md`:

**Other Platforms Already Censoring:**
- ✅ Xiaohongshu: Aggressive post suppression (immediate)
- ✅ WeChat: Article deletions within 24 hours (Dec 20-21)
- ✅ Weibo: Engagement manipulation within 24 hours
- ✅ Hospital: Deleted own statement within hours (Dec 20)

**Douyin Currently Permissive:**
- ✅ Family account active with 292K followers
- ✅ Mother posted autopsy report screenshots (Dec 19)
- ✅ Parents live-streamed hospital visits
- ✅ Mother's 17-minute live stream allowed (Jan 6)

**BUT:**
- ⚠️ This permissiveness could END AT ANY MOMENT
- ⚠️ Once censorship directive issued, account deleted overnight
- ⚠️ Pattern shows rapid escalation after key events (autopsy → deletions)

**Critical Window:** 24-48 hours before risk becomes HIGH

## What CEO Needs to Do

### Immediate (Next 24 Hours)

**1. Assign Human Worker**
- Needs: Basic computer skills, can follow instructions
- Time: 3-4 hours active + overnight availability
- Tools: Computer, internet, VPN (if outside China)

**2. Verify Account Status**
- Check if @小洛熙妈妈 still accessible: https://www.douyin.com
- Note current follower count (baseline: 292K)
- Check most recent post date

**3. Provide Resources**
- Ensure 15GB free storage space
- VPN service (if outside China): ExpressVPN or Astrill
- Worker has access to work/archiving/ folder

**4. Communicate Urgency**
- This is time-critical (not "when you get to it")
- Archive BEFORE detailed review/analysis
- Download first, analyze later

### During Archiving (Hours 24-48)

**5. Support Worker**
- Available for questions/troubleshooting
- Do NOT micromanage (let batch downloads run)
- Check in at key milestones (profile done, downloads started, verification complete)

**6. Monitor Accounts**
- Daily check if family accounts still active
- Note any censorship/restriction signs
- If account deleted mid-operation, activate recovery plan (see instructions.md)

### After Completion (Hour 48+)

**7. Receive Report**
- Total videos archived
- Any censored/unavailable content found
- Issues encountered
- Backup status

**8. Verify Archive**
- Spot-check 5-10 videos play correctly
- Confirm cloud backup uploaded
- Review metadata spreadsheet

**9. Brief Teams**
- Content Production: High-priority assets available
- Outreach: Evidence preserved for distribution
- Strategy: Update plans based on archive findings

**10. Plan Next Steps**
- Translate high-priority video descriptions
- Extract key clips for social media
- Subtitle videos for Western audiences
- Consider secondary platform archiving (Weibo, Zhihu)

---

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Success
- ✅ 25+ HIGH priority videos downloaded
- ✅ Both account profiles documented

- ✅ One backup copy created

**This = Mission Success.** Core evidence preserved.

### Target Success
- ✅ 80%+ of all videos downloaded
- ✅ Detailed metadata complete
- ✅ Comments archived for top 10 videos
- ✅ Multiple cloud backups

**This = Strong Success.** Comprehensive archive.

### Ideal Success

**This = Perfect Success.** Nothing lost.

## Risk Assessment

| Scenario | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|----------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Account already deleted** | LOW-MEDIUM | CRITICAL | Check status immediately; activate recovery plan |
| **Partial censorship ongoing** | MEDIUM | HIGH | Document as evidence; prioritize HIGH videos first |
| **Tools fail** | LOW-MEDIUM | MEDIUM | 3 tool options provided; troubleshooting guide |
| **Worker gets stuck** | LOW | MEDIUM | Detailed instructions; CEO support available |
| **Downloads too slow** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Overnight batch processing; prioritize high-value |
| **Censorship during archiving** | LOW (24hr) / MEDIUM (48hr) | HIGH | Start ASAP; high-priority first |

**Overall Risk Level (if started within 24hrs):** MODERATE
**Overall Risk Level (if delayed 48+hrs):** HIGH

## What This Archive Enables

### Immediate Uses
1. **Content Production:** Raw material for social media videos
2. **Evidence Preservation:** Family's timeline cannot be erased
3. **Censorship Documentation:** Proof if/when content deleted
4. **Media Outreach:** Authentic source material for journalists

### Strategic Value
1. **Legal Evidence:** Timeline, medical claims, family testimony preserved
2. **Narrative Control:** Family's voice protected from censorship
3. **Public Sentiment:** Comments show widespread support
4. **Historical Record:** Case documented for future reference

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Platform Independence:** Not reliant on Douyin's continued access
2. **Redundancy:** Multiple backups protect against deletion/account loss
3. **Flexibility:** Can distribute via any channel (not locked to Douyin)

**Without This Archive:**
- ❌ If Douyin deletes account tomorrow, 292K follower audience + all content GONE
- ❌ Family's 2-month documentation effort erased
- ❌ Evidence lost
- ❌ Censorship succeeds

**With This Archive:**
- ✅ Content preserved regardless of platform censorship
- ✅ Evidence secure for legal/advocacy use
- ✅ Family's story cannot be silenced
- ✅ Censorship exposed if deletion occurs

## Questions?

**For technical issues during archiving:**
- See instructions.md Troubleshooting section (10+ common problems solved)

**For strategic questions:**
- Contact CEO
- Reference archiving-methodology.md for justification/context

**For priority questions:**
- See priority-list.md

## Critical Reminder

**This is a race against censorship.**

Chinese authorities have:
- Deleted WeChat articles within 24 hours
- Suppressed Xiaohongshu posts immediately
- Removed hospital statements within hours
- Manipulated Weibo engagement within 24 hours

Douyin has been permissive SO FAR. That could change at any moment.

**Start within 24 hours. Complete within 48 hours.**

**The family's story depends on it.**
