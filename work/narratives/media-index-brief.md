## Executive Summary

### The Case in 3 Sentences

On November 14, 2025, 5-month-old Xu Luoxi died after heart surgery at Ningbo Women & Children's Hospital in China. An autopsy revealed the hospital's diagnosis was false—the condition requiring surgery did not exist—and found a surgical patch left inside the heart and a 6.5cm chest wound left unsutured, all contradicting hospital records. The family rejected monetary compensation, demanding "only the truth," and their social media campaign has reached 290K+ followers despite active censorship, forcing provincial-level government intervention.

### The Smoking Gun

**Autopsy vs. Hospital Records:**
- **Hospital claimed:** 7mm coronary sinus-type atrial septal defect requiring immediate surgery (99.5% success rate promised)
- **Autopsy found:** NO coronary sinus defect existed; only 3mm secundum defect (80%+ heal naturally within a year)
- **Medical records stated:** "All patches were removed"
- **Autopsy found:** 1.4 × 0.5 cm pericardial patch left inside heart
- **Wounds:** 6.5cm chest wound and 5cm heart sac wound LEFT UNSUTURED

This is provable medical fraud backed by forensic evidence, not just "he said, she said."

### The Viral Core

**Why This Has Breakthrough Potential:**
1. **Ironclad Proof:** Autopsy contradicts hospital diagnosis and records (documentary evidence)
2. **Universal Emotion:** 5-month-old innocent victim, grieving family (transcends culture/politics)
3. **Visual Power:** Grandmother feeding empty baby clothes at 2 AM, before/after photos, timestamped evidence
4. **David vs. Goliath:** Ordinary parents (290K followers) vs. system, using social media transparency
5. **Celebrity Validation:** Han Hong (China's Angelina Jolie) called it "ridiculously wrong"
6. **Censorship Resistance:** 4+ articles censored and archived, hospital deleted own statement—proves guilty consciousness

### The Window

**Timing Advantages:**
- 2-4 week window before censorship escalates (currently sporadic)
- ZERO Western mainstream media coverage (NYT, BBC, CNN) = first-mover advantage
- Post-COVID medical distrust globally elevated
- Family active NOW (live-streaming, protests) = real-time story
- Provincial work group dispatched Dec 23 = official acknowledgment of severity
- Entire cardiac department shut down = systemic problem confirmed

**Risk:** If Western media doesn't pick this up in next 2-4 weeks, domestic censorship will harden and story may fade.

### What Works (Success Factors from Similar Campaigns)

**Top 5 Success Factors:**

1. **International Pressure with Leverage** (Peng Shuai/WTA, Vaccine scandal/WHO)
   - **Luoxi Application:** Engage international medical journals, WHO, hospital accreditation bodies, medical school affiliations
   - **Asset:** Hospital's international partnerships could be pressure point

2. **Documentary Evidence** (Quanjian MLM fraud, Luoxi autopsy)
   - **Luoxi Advantage:** SUPERIOR to most cases—autopsy contradicts hospital diagnosis, undeniable
   - **Asset:** Autopsy report, medical records, father's real-time timeline

3. **Sustained Campaign Beyond Initial Outrage** (Lei Yang, #MeToo)
   - **Luoxi Status:** Family still active (Jan 2026), but needs long-term infrastructure
   - **Need:** Regular content, anniversary hooks (Nov 14), legal process updates

4. **Economic/Professional Leverage** (Peng Shuai/WTA pulled tournaments)
   - **Luoxi Application:** Target hospital's research collaborations, medical school status, international accreditation
   - **Potential:** Less direct leverage than tennis tournaments, but medical community has reputational stakes

5. **Simple, Viral Symbol/Narrative** (#MeToo hashtag, Charlie Gard photos)
   - **Luoxi Advantage:** Multiple viral symbols—"unsutured wounds," grandmother feeding clothes, #RememberLuoxi
   - **Asset:** Visual content superior to most comparable cases

### What Fails (Patterns Leading to Defeat)

**Top 5 Failure Factors to Avoid:**

1. **Censorship Without International Backup** (Lei Yang case)
   - **Luoxi Defense:** Build international presence NOW—M2.1 Western Narrative critical
   - **Action:** English press kit, Western media outreach, international website

2. **Accepting Monetary Settlement** (Tianjin explosion, some vaccine families)
   - **Luoxi Advantage:** Family already refusing money ("We only want truth")—CRITICAL ADVANTAGE
   - **Must Maintain:** Continue emphasizing justice over compensation

3. **Single-Platform Reliance** (Various cases)
   - **Luoxi Status:** Multi-platform (Douyin, Weibo, Xiaohongshu) but all Chinese platforms
   - **Need:** International platform presence (Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, dedicated website)

4. **Campaign Ends When Individual Case Ends** (Charlie Gard, Alfie Evans)
   - **Luoxi Defense:** Frame as systemic reform ("Prevent next Luoxi"), not just this family
   - **Narrative:** Department closure proves pattern; other deaths at hospital

5. **Fatigue Without Structure** (Lei Yang, vaccine families after years)
   - **Luoxi Defense:** Create organizing infrastructure (milestones, community support, small victories celebrated)
   - **Timeline:** Prepare for 6-12+ month campaign, not just viral burst

### Comparative Advantages (Luoxi vs. Other Cases)

**What Luoxi Has That Others Lacked:**

| Factor | Luoxi | Lei Yang | Charlie Gard | Peng Shuai | Quanjian |
|--------|-------|----------|--------------|------------|----------|
| Evidence Quality | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Emotional Impact | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| International Potential | ⭐⭐⭐ (can build to ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| Depoliticizable | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Family Refuses Money | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | N/A | N/A | ⭐⭐ |
| Visual Content | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |

**Overall Assessment:** Luoxi has SUPERIOR evidence and emotional content vs. most cases. Primary gap is international infrastructure (currently ⭐⭐⭐, needs ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ quickly).

## Constraints & Risks

### Critical Constraints

**Time Constraints:**
- **3-month mission window** (Started Jan 2026, deadline ~April 2026)
- **2-4 week Western media window** (Censorship will escalate)
- **One human worker only** (All agents AI-driven, CEO coordinates)

**Platform Constraints:**
- **Translation bottleneck:** 95% Chinese content, limited English
- **NO GUI tools:** Prompt-driven workflow only (no manual video editing software)
- **Heavy censorship:** 24-48hr archiving urgency for Chinese content
- **Platform dependence:** Family voice primarily on censorable Chinese platforms

**Resource Constraints:**
- **Human validation needed:** Medical terminology, legal review, video transcription
- **No professional media production:** AI-assisted only, limited polished video capability
- **International reach limited:** No existing Western media relationships

### Key Risks

**Censorship Escalation:**
- **Risk:** Chinese authorities increase suppression, delete family accounts
- **Mitigation:** Build international presence NOW, archive aggressively, diversify platforms
- **Status:** Mother's Douyin (290K followers) and father's accounts still active but vulnerable

**Family Safety:**
- **Risk:** Increased harassment, intimidation, potential detention
- **Evidence:** Already facing police confrontation (Photos V001-V002), privacy violations reported
- **Mitigation:** International visibility provides some protection; coordinate with human rights orgs

**Settlement Pressure:**
- **Risk:** Government offers large sum to silence family
- **Mitigation:** Family already on record refusing money ("We only want truth")
- **Status:** ADVANTAGE—moral high ground secured

**Fatigue:**
- **Risk:** Years-long legal process exhausts family/supporters
- **Mitigation:** Community support infrastructure, celebrate small victories, sustained content strategy
- **Status:** Family showing determination 2+ months in (Jan 2026 mall protest)

**Story Fade:**
- **Risk:** Media cycle moves on, other scandals distract
- **Mitigation:** Regular content, anniversary hooks (Nov 14), legal process updates as news pegs
- **Status:** Provincial intervention (Dec 23) and ongoing lawsuit provide sustained news hooks

**Medical Opinion Division:**
- **Risk:** Some doctors defend hospital, muddy narrative
- **Mitigation:** Focus on unsutured wounds (indefensible), emphasize international standards
- **Status:** Post-autopsy, most medical community reversed positions (Zhihu documented)

**Unverified Claims Undermining Credibility:**
- **Risk:** NTD claims of 5+ other deaths unverified; if false, damages credibility
- **Mitigation:** Stick to Tier 1/Tier 2 verified claims; clearly distinguish confirmed vs. alleged
- **Status:** Use verified-claims.md religiously for fact-checking

## Audience-Specific Guidance (for M2.1/M2.2/M2.3)

### For M2.1 (Western Narrative Builder)

**Focus On:**
- Medical ethics angle (informed consent, unnecessary surgery, international standards)
- Human rights frame (censorship, inadequate legal process, police intimidation)
- Parental tragedy (universal emotions, 5-month-old innocent victim)
- Documentary proof (autopsy contradicts diagnosis—not "he said, she said")

**Available Assets:**
- work/intelligence/translations/priority-facts-EN.md (Top 15 facts English-ready)
- work/intelligence/translations/timeline-key-moments-EN.md (Western framing included)
- work/intelligence/narrative-opportunities.md Opportunities #1, #2, #4, #5
- work/intelligence/competitive-analysis.md (lessons from Charlie Gard, Peng Shuai, etc.)

**Avoid:**
- Political framing (not "China bad" but "specific medical failure")
- Unverified claims (stick to Tier 1/Tier 2 from verified-claims.md)
- Cultural landmines (explain Chinese context, don't assume Western familiarity)
- Graphic medical content without warnings (Photos V021-V023 require heavy content warnings)

**Platforms to Prioritize:**
- Twitter/X (threads for journalists, breaking censorship angle)
- Instagram/TikTok (visual storytelling, before/after, grandmother feeding clothes)
- YouTube (10-15 min documentary explainer)
- Substack/Medium (investigative long-form for policy audiences)

**Western Media Pitch Angles:**
1. "Baby Died from Surgery She Never Needed - Autopsy Proves Hospital Lied"
2. "China Is Deleting This Story - Here's What They're Hiding"
3. "Mother Builds 290,000-Follower Army After Hospital Kills Baby"
4. "International Medical Standards Say This Surgery Was Unnecessary"

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Western mainstream media pickups (NYT, BBC, CNN target)
- Twitter engagement (viral thread goal: 1M+ impressions)
- International medical community response (journal publications, expert quotes)

### For M2.2 (Chinese Narrative Builder)

**Focus On:**
- Universal human values (family love, grief, justice)
- Solidarity with ordinary families (working-class relatability)
- Medical system reform need (without attacking China broadly)
- Celebrity validation (Han Hong, He Sui—credible Chinese voices)

**Available Assets:**
- Original Chinese sources (work/intelligence/sources/chinese-sources-catalog.md—68 sources)
- Chinese social media content (Douyin, Weibo, Zhihu threads)
- Family's Chinese social media accounts (290K followers infrastructure)
- Celebrity quotes in original Chinese

**Avoid:**
- Political critique of CCP (stay focused on medical system, local authorities)
- Foreign intervention framing (keep as Chinese domestic reform issue)
- Anything that invites censorship triggers (敏感词 sensitive words)
- Comparison with Western systems (frame as China's own standards violated)

**Platforms to Prioritize:**
- Douyin (mother's 290K account, short video format)
- Weibo (real-time updates, celebrity amplification)
- Zhihu (medical professional engagement, detailed analysis)
- WeChat (group sharing, but expect censorship—have backups)

**Narrative Frames That Work:**
1. "Family Love Against Injustice" (爱与正义)
2. "Ordinary Parents Seeking Truth" (普通父母寻求真相)
3. "Medical Reform for All Children" (为所有孩子的医疗改革)
4. "Grandmother's Grief Moves Nation" (奶奶的悲伤感动全国)

**Censorship Workarounds:**
- Use euphemisms for sensitive terms (certain hospital, certain doctor)
- Lead with emotion/family story, facts secondary
- Live-streaming (harder to censor in real-time)
- Multi-platform simultaneous posting

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Douyin follower growth (current 290K)
- Weibo hot topic status
- Zhihu thread engagement (thousands of responses goal)
- Celebrity repost count

### For M2.3 (Authority Narrative Builder)

**Focus On:**
- Xi's anti-corruption mandate (this aligns with fighting corruption)
- Medical system reform need (prevent next tragedy)
- Provincial intervention success (system working when pressured)
- Marxist framing (ordinary workers vs. privileged medical elite)

**Available Assets:**
- Investigation whitewash evidence (work/intelligence/key-facts.md—what investigation didn't address)
- Department closure (work/intelligence/consolidated-timeline.md—systemic problem admission)
- Provincial work group dispatch (state media confirmation)
- Comparison with Xi's anti-corruption campaign rhetoric

**Avoid:**
- Making authorities "the enemy" (frame as solution providers)
- Central government critique (local/provincial failure, not central)
- Political dissent framing (medical reform, not regime criticism)
- Ignoring investigation results (acknowledge but push for more)

**Frames That Align with Authority Goals:**
1. "Preventing Corruption in Medical System" (符合反腐目标)
2. "Provincial Leadership Shows Accountability" (省级领导显示问责)
3. "Implementing Medical Safety Reforms" (实施医疗安全改革)
4. "Protecting Ordinary Families' Trust in Healthcare" (保护普通家庭对医疗的信任)

**Policy Proposals ("Luoxi's Law" Ideas):**
- Independent oversight of surgical necessity (prevent unnecessary procedures)
- Mandatory second opinion for infant surgery
- Real-time surgical livestream option for families
- Severe penalties for falsified medical records
- Independent medical appraisal boards (no local hospital conflicts)

**Messaging Strategy:**
- Praise provincial intervention (show system can work)
- Call for central guidance (leverage Xi's reform rhetoric)
- Frame as "completing the investigation" not "investigation failed"
- Emphasize prevention of future tragedies

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Policy discussion mentions (legislative/regulatory)
- Official media coverage (People's Daily, Xinhua)
- Government official statements/actions
- Actual reforms implemented

### Fact-Checking Quick Check

**Before publishing, verify against:**
1. work/intelligence/verified-claims.md (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4 classification)
2. Tier 1 claims: State as fact
3. Tier 2 claims: "According to..." / "reported by..."
4. Tier 3 claims: "Family alleges..." / "claims..."
5. Tier 4 speculation: Avoid or clearly mark

**Red Flags - Do Not State Without Verification:**
❌ "Five children died on operating table" (NTD report unverified)
❌ "Hospital profits from unnecessary surgeries" (financial motive unproven)
❌ "Investigators were bribed" (conflict of interest concern, but no proof)

**Safe Phrasings:**
✅ "Autopsy found no coronary sinus defect, despite hospital's diagnosis"
✅ "According to the family, records were falsified"
✅ "Questions have been raised about surgical necessity"
