# Agent Report: M2.1 Western Narrative Strategist

**Agent:** M2.1 - Western Narrative Strategist
**Date:** January 13, 2026
**Phase:** Phase 2 - Narrative Architecture
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Executive Summary

Developed comprehensive Western viral narrative framework with 8 story angles optimized for English-speaking audiences with zero knowledge of Chinese healthcare/politics. Framework emphasizes universal emotions (parental love, medical betrayal, David vs. Goliath) and platform-specific optimization (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, X/Twitter).

**Top 3 angles ready for immediate production:**
1. "A Grandmother Feeds Empty Clothes at 2AM" (10/10 viral potential - emotional breakthrough)
2. "The 99.5% Surgery That Killed a Baby" (8/10 - documentary proof of medical fraud)
3. "Remember Her Name: Luoxi" (8/10 - humanization and sustained campaign symbol)

**Estimated reach:** 10M+ impressions in first 2 weeks (conservative), 40M+ if influencer/media pickup occurs. All angles depoliticized, evidence-based, with clear CTAs. Framework includes platform-specific hooks, A/B testing plans, cultural adaptation notes, and evidence mapping.

**Critical finding:** Photo of grandmother feeding empty clothes at 2:05 AM is THE breakthrough asset - universal emotional resonance requiring zero translation or context. Lead with this.

## Key Findings

### Angle Rankings by Viral Potential

**Tier 1: Breakthrough Potential (8-10/10)**
1. Angle 3: "Grandmother Feeds Empty Clothes" - 10/10 (iconic image potential, no context needed)
2. Angle 1: "99.5% Surgery That Killed a Baby" - 8/10 (perfect emotion + evidence blend)
3. Angle 7: "Remember Her Name: Luoxi" - 8/10 (humanization, sustained campaign symbol)

**Tier 2: Strong Viral Potential (6-7/10)**
4. Angle 2: "What They Don't Want You To See" - 7/10 (censorship angle for Western audiences)
5. Angle 5: "290K Parents vs. System—And They're Winning" - 7/10 (empowerment, activism tactics)

**Tier 3: Strategic Value (5-6/10)**
6. Angle 8: "Could This Happen Where You Live?" - 6/10 (personal relevance, institutional pressure)
7. Angle 4: "Hospital That Kills Babies for Profit" - 6/10 (investigative, requires careful framing)
8. Angle 6: "International Medical Community Must Speak" - 5/10 (depoliticized, slow burn, high credibility)

### Production Readiness

**Ready NOW (launch this week):**
- Angle 3: Grandmother photo (2-4 hours)
- Angle 7: Remember her name (4-6 hours)
- Angle 1: Short version 60-sec (6-8 hours)

**Week 2-3:**
- Angle 1: Long version 10-15 min (3-5 days)
- Angle 2: Censorship (2-3 days)
- Angle 5: 290K followers (2-3 days)

**Week 3-4+ (requires research):**
- Angle 8: Medical school partnerships (1-2 weeks)
- Angle 4: Profit motive (2-3 weeks)
- Angle 6: Medical community (2-4 weeks)

### Cultural Adaptation Insights

**What translates universally:**
- Parental/grandparent love (no explanation needed)
- Documentary evidence (autopsy contradicts hospital)
- Numbers (5 months, 99.5%, 290K followers)
- Before/after photos (visual storytelling)
- "We don't want money, we want truth" (moral high ground)

**What requires simplification:**
- Chinese government hierarchy → "authorities"
- Platform names → "Chinese TikTok (Douyin)"
- Currency → Always convert RMB to USD
- Celebrity significance → "China's Beyoncé" equivalents
- Legal process → Simple terms only

**Golden rule:** If it requires >1 sentence to explain Chinese context, simplify or skip. Focus stays on universal human story.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)

1. **Launch Angle 3 first** (grandmother photo) - within 48 hours across all platforms simultaneously
2. **Measure response** - if <100K views in 48 hours, reassess strategy
3. **Launch Angle 7** (Remember Luoxi) 24-48 hours after Angle 3
4. **Launch Angle 1 short version** within 1 week
5. **Set up tracking** - metrics dashboard for all platforms

### Week 2-3 Priorities

1. **Scale winners** from A/B testing
2. **Produce long-form content** (Angle 1 YouTube documentary)
3. **Deploy secondary angles** (2, 5) to engaged audiences
4. **Begin journalist outreach** with Angle 3 + Angle 1 package
5. **Build infrastructure** (memorial website, petition, hashtag consolidation)

### Sustained Campaign Strategy

1. **Deploy institutional pressure angles** (6, 8) once credibility established
2. **Monthly content refreshes** with news hooks
3. **Annual remembrance** (November 14 becomes recurring event)
4. **Community building** (UGC, follower stories, movement infrastructure)

### Success Metrics Thresholds

**Phase 1 (Week 1-2):** 10M+ total impressions, 5K+ petition signatures
**Phase 2 (Week 3-4):** Influencer pickups (5-10 accounts 100K+ followers), mainstream media mentions begin
**Phase 3 (Month 2-3):** Major outlet coverage (NYT/BBC/CNN), 40M+ total reach, institutional responses

## Blockers / Issues

### No Critical Blockers

All top 3 priority angles have assets and translations ready for immediate production.

### Minor Dependencies

1. **Video production capability:** Angle 1 long-form requires video editing skills/tools (not blocking short-form content)
2. **Medical expert validation:** Angle 6 strongest with cardiologist quotes (can proceed without, but enhanced with)
3. **Hospital partnership research:** Angle 8 requires investigation of international medical school collaborations (2-4 weeks research time)

### Risks to Monitor

🚨 **Family safety:** International attention is protective but increases harassment risk - coordinate with human rights orgs
🚨 **Censorship escalation:** Chinese platforms may shut family accounts - international presence NOW is critical
🚨 **Graphic content concerns:** Some photos (medical images) require heavy content warnings - use sparingly

## Next Steps

**For CEO:**
1. Review and approve western-framework.md
2. Prioritize: Deploy Angles 3, 7, 1 immediately OR wait for M2.2/M2.3 completion?
3. Assign to M3 Content Production team with priority order
4. Decide: Launch with organic reach first OR small paid promotion to seed algorithms?

**For M3 Content Production (when deployed):**
1. Start with Angle 3 (grandmother photo) - TikTok, Instagram, X/Twitter
2. Create memorial website for Angle 7 (Remember Luoxi)
3. Produce 60-sec version of Angle 1 (99.5% betrayal)
4. Set up A/B testing infrastructure
5. Begin journalist outreach list compilation

**For M2.2 Chinese Narrative (parallel work):**
- Western framework complete, no dependencies blocking Chinese narrative work
- Can proceed immediately

**For M2.3 Authority Narrative (parallel work):**
- Western framework complete, no dependencies blocking authority narrative work
- Can proceed immediately

## Methodology Notes

**Approach:**
1. Analyzed media-index-brief for Western-translatable facts (universal emotions vs. Chinese context)
2. Mapped evidence to emotional hooks (grandmother photo = grief, autopsy = betrayal, etc.)
3. Developed 8 angles covering different demo/platform/tone combinations
4. Ranked by viral coefficient using comparable case analysis
5. Created platform-specific hooks (TikTok 3-sec, Instagram caption, X/Twitter thread, YouTube 15-sec)
6. Built A/B testing framework with success metrics
7. Prioritized by production readiness + viral potential

**Principles applied:**
- Universal emotions over political framing
- Documentary evidence for credibility (depoliticized)
- Platform-native optimization (TikTok story on TikTok)
- Cultural adaptation (simplify Chinese context)
- Action > despair (always include CTA)
- Humanization (never "a baby," always "Luoxi")

## Contact / Questions

**Completed deliverable:** work/narratives/western-framework.md (ready for CEO review and M3 production)

**Time to completion:** 6 hours (reading brief, developing angles, writing framework)

**Confidence level:** HIGH - Top 3 angles have proven templates (comparable cases), ready assets, and clear production paths. Breakthrough potential strong if executed well.

**Final note:** The grandmother photo (2:05 AM) is the single most powerful asset for Western breakthrough. It transcends language, culture, politics. If this image doesn't move people, nothing will. Lead with this.
