# Luoxi Campaign - Strategic Plan

## Mission
Create external pressure through viral social media campaigns to force Chinese authorities to:
1. Acknowledge and prosecute the corruption chain (hospital, provincial commission)
2. Implement systemic medical oversight reforms with transparency and checks

## Strategic Approach

**Path to Impact:** Viral social media → Engaged audience → Mainstream media → International pressure → Chinese authority response → Systemic reform

**Constraints:**
- No mainstream media connections
- Limited human resources
- No production budget
- Heavy Chinese censorship

**Leverage:**
- AI content generation (scalable)
- Uncensored Western platforms
- Universal human emotions
- Existing grassroots outrage

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Intelligence
**Objective:** Build knowledge base and identify narrative opportunities

### Milestones:
- **M1.1** Complete Chinese internet source research (Xiaohongshu, Weibo, etc.)
  - Deliverable: Categorized source database in work/intelligence/sources/
  - Success: 50+ unique Chinese sources catalogued
  - **CRITICAL:** Never edit sources/ - that is human-curated. Sub-agent findings go in work/

- **M1.2** Parse and categorize human-curated materials

  - Success: 3-5 viable narrative angles identified

- **M1.4** Consolidate timeline and key facts
  - Deliverable: Single digestible timeline + key facts document in work/intelligence/
  - Success: Easy-to-load context for other subagents (original sources too large)
  - **Critical for:** Enabling all downstream content production

**Timeline: TODAY (6-8 hours)**

## Phase 2: Narrative Architecture
**Objective:** Develop core messaging frameworks for multi-audience strategy

### Milestones:
- **M2.0** Compile viral ammunition facts

## Phase 3: Content Production Infrastructure
**Objective:** Build scalable AI-powered content generation systems

**CRITICAL: Human labor is extremely limited. All content production must be maximally scriptable.**

### Content Production Philosophy:
- **Text content:** Subagents create 100% of text (captions, scripts, posts)
- **Media content:** Subagents research and select tools that are prompt-driven
- **NO GUI tools:** No Adobe Premiere, Photoshop, manual editing
- **YES scriptable tools:** AI video generators, text-to-speech, prompt-based image tools
- **Human role:** Copy-paste prompts into AI generators, upload final outputs

### Milestones:
- **M3.1** Research prompt-driven AI content tools
  - Deliverable: Vetted list of AI tools for video, image, audio generation
  - Success: Each tool is prompt-driven with minimal human manual work
  - Examples: Runway, Pika, ElevenLabs, Midjourney, etc.

- **M3.2** Platform-specific content templates
  - Deliverable: Production templates for TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram, X
  - Success: Each template optimized for platform algorithm and format

- **M3.3** AI content generation prompt libraries
  - Deliverable: Extensive prompt sets for each tool + platform combination
  - Success: Human can copy-paste prompts directly into AI tools
  - Format: Organized prompt files with clear instructions for human

- **M3.4** Initial content library (Batch 1)
  - Deliverable: 20-30 pieces of production-ready content (scripts + prompts)
  - Success: Mix of formats, tested narratives, platform-optimized
  - **Note:** "Production-ready" = complete scripts + AI tool prompts ready to execute

**Timeline: Days 2-3**

## Risk Management

**Risk: Content censored on platforms**

**Risk: Insufficient virality**
- Mitigation: Rapid A/B testing, narrative pivots, platform algorithm optimization

**Risk: Chinese counter-narrative**
- Mitigation: Stick to verified facts, pre-emptive framing, maintain moral high ground

**Risk: Story fatigue**
- Mitigation: Fresh angles, new developments, sustained content variety

**Risk: Mainstream media disinterest**
- Mitigation: Build audience first, create newsworthy moments, direct outreach

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Spawn sub-agent:** Chinese media source researcher
2. **Spawn sub-agent:** Existing media parser and categorizer
3. **Spawn sub-agent:** Narrative strategist for multi-audience frameworks
4. Begin Phase 1 execution immediately
