# Luoxi Campaign - Strategic Plan

## Mission
Create external pressure through viral social media campaigns to force Chinese authorities to:
1. Acknowledge and prosecute the corruption chain (hospital, provincial commission)
2. Implement systemic medical oversight reforms with transparency and checks

## Strategic Approach

**Path to Impact:** Viral social media → Engaged audience → Mainstream media → International pressure → Chinese authority response → Systemic reform

**Constraints:**
- **3-month mission window** - capitalize on momentum before censorship/attention fade
- **ONE human worker only** - maximize scriptability, minimal manual tasks
- **No external Chinese expert help** - censorship risk, personal danger
- **95% content Chinese-only** - translation bottleneck (internal translation subagents)
- **NO GUI tools** - only prompt-driven AI (Runway, ElevenLabs, Midjourney, etc.)
- **No mainstream media connections**
- **No production budget**
- **Heavy Chinese censorship**

**Leverage:**
- AI content generation (scalable)
- Uncensored Western platforms
- Universal human emotions
- Existing grassroots outrage
- First-mover advantage (ZERO Western media coverage)

**Risk: Insufficient virality**
- Mitigation: Rapid A/B testing, narrative pivots, platform algorithm optimization

**Risk: Chinese counter-narrative**
- Mitigation: Stick to verified facts, pre-emptive framing, maintain moral high ground

**Risk: Story fatigue**
- Mitigation: Fresh angles, new developments, sustained content variety

**Risk: Mainstream media disinterest**
- Mitigation: Build audience first, create newsworthy moments, direct outreach

---

## Agent Operating Principles

### Agent Scope & Responsibilities:
- **Execute narrow task:** Focus on assigned milestone, produce deliverable
- **Flag blockers to CEO:** Report cross-cutting issues (translation, archiving, human tasks)
- **Don't solve systemic issues:** CEO coordinates inter-agent dependencies
- **Don't spawn other agents:** CEO assigns all tasks
- **Don't be proactive beyond scope:** Stay focused on deliverable

### What Agents Should Do:
- Complete assigned milestone thoroughly (all milestones matter, skip perfection details)
- Flag when translation is needed (don't solve it yourself)
- Flag when human action is required (archiving, account creation, etc.)
- Report blockers clearly to CEO
- Produce outputs in specified format and location

### What Agents Should NOT Do:
- Spawn other agents or assign tasks
- Attempt to solve translation bottlenecks themselves
- Coordinate with other agents directly
- Be proactive beyond assigned scope
- Recommend "nice-to-have" perfection details (focus on milestones)

### Inter-Phase Communication:
- **Problem:** Agents in Phase N+1 reading all Phase N outputs creates context bloat
- **Solution:** Phase Consolidator pattern
  - M2.0 creates media-index-brief.md for M2.1/M2.2/M2.3
  - M3.0 creates production-brief.md for M3.1-M3.6
  - Each brief ~15-20KB, synthesizes entire previous phase
- **Result:** Clean context handoff between phases

### CEO Responsibilities:
- Assign all agent tasks
- Coordinate translation (spawn translation subagents)
- Coordinate archiving (create human instructions)
- Resolve cross-cutting blockers
- Read lieutenant reports (not all agent outputs)
- Make strategic decisions

### Phase Lieutenant Responsibilities:
- QA all agent deliverables in their phase
- Report quality/gaps/blockers/readiness to CEO
- Keep CEO context clean (CEO reads reports, not all outputs)

## Immediate Next Steps

**Phase 1: COMPLETE ✅**
**Phase 1.5: Ready to spawn**
**Phase 2: Ready after Phase 1.5 completes**

**Correct Sequence:**
1. ✅ Updated strategy.md and company-structure.md
2. ✅ Updated all 21 agent instruction files with latest plan + world-class talent framing
3. **NEXT:** Await human approval to spawn Phase 1.5 agents (Translation, Video, Archiving)
4. **AFTER 1.5:** Spawn M2.0 (Media Index Brief Creator) to consolidate
5. **AFTER M2.0:** Spawn M2.1/M2.2/M2.3 (narrative strategists using consolidated brief)

---

*This strategy is designed for iteration. Milestones will be updated based on performance data and environmental changes.*
