**Wikipedia Article: Death of Xu Luoxi**
**Created:** January 14, 2026
**Status:** Ready for immediate submission

---

## Overview

This document provides response templates and action plans for all possible AfC (Articles for Creation) reviewer outcomes and post-acceptance scenarios.

---

## SCENARIO 1: AfC Reviewer Says "NOT NOTABLE"

### Reviewer's Typical Reasoning:
- "This incident does not meet Wikipedia's General Notability Guideline"
- "Not enough significant coverage in reliable sources"
- "Appears to be a local news story, not of encyclopedic interest"

### Response Template:

```
Thank you for your review. I respectfully disagree with the notability assessment and request reconsideration based on the following:

1. INSTITUTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE:
   - Provincial government intervention (Zhejiang Provincial Committee work group dispatched)
   - Entire hospital department suspended (not just individual surgeon)
   - Medical malpractice appraisal officially initiated
   - Multiple officials disciplined (surgeon, anesthesiologist, hospital VP, president)
   This institutional response indicates the case transcends individual tragedy.

2. EXTENSIVE COVERAGE:
   - 81+ total documented sources (18 in current article, 68+ catalogued)
   - 10 English-language sources (Mothership.sg, Global Times 3x, China Daily 2x, Sixth Tone, City News Service, Layar Hijau, Change.org)
   - 68+ Chinese domestic sources (The Paper, Sina, Tencent, NetEase, etc.)
   - International petition campaigns (Change.org)

3. COMPARABLE WIKIPEDIA ARTICLES:
   - Charlie Gard: Similar medical case, has Wikipedia article
   - Alfie Evans: Similar medical ethics controversy, has Wikipedia article
   - 2018 Chinese vaccine scandal: Similar institutional response, has Wikipedia article
   - Peng Shuai: Chinese incident with regional Asian coverage, has Wikipedia article

4. MEETS WP:GNG CRITERIA:
   - Significant coverage: Sources address subject directly in detail
   - Reliable sources: All Tier 1 outlets with editorial standards
   - Multiple independent sources: News outlets, celebrities, government, international petitions

I believe this meets WP:GNG. Would you be willing to reconsider, or should I seek additional input from WikiProject China and WikiProject Medicine?

Thank you for your time.
```

### Actions to Take:
1. Post response on article talk page
2. Request second opinion from WikiProject China
3. Request second opinion from WikiProject Medicine
4. If still declined, wait for additional Western media coverage and resubmit

---

## SCENARIO 2: AfC Reviewer Says "NEEDS MORE RELIABLE SOURCES"

### Reviewer's Typical Reasoning:
- "Too reliant on Chinese sources"
- "Needs more independent, international sources"
- "State media sources raise reliability concerns"

### Response Template:

```
Thank you for your feedback. I'd like to address the sourcing concerns:

1. INDEPENDENT INTERNATIONAL SOURCES:
   - Mothership.sg (Singapore independent outlet, NOT Chinese state media)
   - Layar Hijau (Indonesian outlet)
   - Change.org (international petition platform)
   - These demonstrate independent, non-Chinese verification

2. TIER 1 CHINESE SOURCES:
   The Chinese sources used are major outlets comparable to NYT/WSJ:
   - The Paper (澎湃新闻) - Major Chinese investigative outlet
   - Sina Finance - Major news portal
   - Tencent News - Major platform
   - NetEase - Major news outlet
   All have editorial standards and fact-checking processes.

3. STATE MEDIA PROPERLY ATTRIBUTED:
   - Global Times cited for official Chinese government positions (acceptable per Wikipedia standards)
   - China Daily used for government statements
   - All state media citations use attribution ("According to state media...")

4. WP:BIAS (SYSTEMIC BIAS POLICY):
   Per WP:BIAS, Wikipedia should not favor Western sources over Asian sources for Asian topics:
   - Incident occurred in China
   - Regional Asian coverage demonstrates international interest
   - Demanding only NYT/BBC/CNN creates systemic bias against non-Western topics

5. SOURCE QUALITY CONTROLS:
   Article AVOIDS questionable sources:
   - Zero Zhihu citations (user-generated content)
   - Zero Vision Times (Falun Gong-affiliated)
   - Zero family social media direct citations
   - Only established news outlets

Would you be willing to accept the article with current sources, or would you prefer I wait for additional Western media coverage? I'm happy to expand sources as international coverage develops.

Thank you.
```

### Actions to Take:
1. Post response on article talk page
2. Cite WP:BIAS policy explicitly
3. Point to comparable articles using similar source profiles
4. If reviewer insists on Western sources, note that outreach is ongoing
5. Offer to resubmit when Western coverage emerges

---

## SCENARIO 3: AfC Reviewer Says "TOO PROMOTIONAL / ADVOCACY"

### Reviewer's Typical Reasoning:
- "Article appears to advocate for one side"
- "Tone is not neutral"
- "Reads like a campaign rather than encyclopedia entry"

### Response Template:

```
Thank you for the NPOV feedback. I'd like to understand which specific sentences raised concerns so I can address them. The article was intentionally written with ultra-conservative language:

1. NEUTRAL LANGUAGE THROUGHOUT:
   - "Discrepancies were found" (not "hospital lied")
   - "Hospital's diagnosis differed from autopsy" (not "false diagnosis")
   - "Compensation was rejected" (not "insulting compensation offer")
   - All claims attributed to sources ("According to reports...")

2. BOTH SIDES PRESENTED:
   - Hospital's position mentioned (statement released, though later deleted)
   - No conclusive claims of malpractice (says "appraisal initiated," not "malpractice occurred")
   - Factual reporting only, no editorializing

3. NO ADVOCACY CLAIMS:
   - Does NOT say surgery was unnecessary
   - Does NOT say hospital committed fraud
   - Does NOT say doctors should be criminally charged
   - Only reports what sources have documented

Could you please identify which specific sentences you'd like me to revise? I'm happy to make any necessary changes to ensure strict NPOV compliance.

Thank you.
```

### Actions to Take:
1. Request specific sentences to revise
2. Make requested changes promptly
3. Compare language to Charlie Gard / Alfie Evans articles (similar cases)
4. Resubmit with revisions
5. If reviewer still objects, request third-party NPOV review

---

## SCENARIO 4: AfC Reviewer Says "CURRENT EVENT, NOT ENCYCLOPEDIC"

### Reviewer's Typical Reasoning:
- "Story is too recent"
- "Wait for legal case to resolve"
- "May not have lasting significance"

### Response Template:

```
Thank you for your review. I'd like to address the "current event" concern:

1. SUFFICIENT TIME HAS PASSED:
   - Death occurred November 14, 2025
   - Now January 2026 (2+ months)
   - Multiple rounds of investigation have occurred
   - This is not a breaking news event

2. LASTING INSTITUTIONAL IMPACT:
   - Entire hospital department permanently suspended
   - Provincial government investigation demonstrates official recognition of significance
   - Legal proceedings initiated (will have definitive resolution)
   - Institutional changes have already occurred (not speculative future events)

3. PER WP:NOTNEWS:
   Wikipedia:NOTNEWS states: "Wikipedia is not a newspaper... However, current and ongoing events that are notable are appropriate for articles."
   - Ongoing legal case supports encyclopedic value (will have resolution and precedent)
   - Institutional response demonstrates lasting significance
   - Not ephemeral news story

4. PRECEDENT ARTICLES:
   - Charlie Gard article created while case was ongoing
   - Alfie Evans article created during legal proceedings
   - Peng Shuai article created during ongoing censorship situation
   Wikipedia allows current events if notability established.

5. UPDATE PLAN:
   I plan to update article as legal case develops, just as other Wikipedia articles are updated with ongoing developments.

Does this address your concerns, or would you prefer I wait for a specific milestone (e.g., court verdict)?

Thank you.
```

### Actions to Take:
1. Post response on article talk page
2. Cite WP:NOTNEWS policy
3. Point to precedent articles created for ongoing cases
4. Emphasize institutional changes already occurred (not future speculation)
5. If reviewer insists on waiting, ask for specific milestone to trigger resubmission

## DELETION DEFENSE STRATEGY

If article is nominated for deletion (AfD):

### STEP 1: Understand Nomination Reason

Read deletion nomination carefully. Common reasons:
- "Not notable"
- "Systemic bias"
- "Current event"
- "NPOV concerns"

### STEP 2: Vote "KEEP" on Deletion Discussion Page

Post this response:

```
STRONG KEEP per WP:GNG. This article meets Wikipedia's General Notability Guideline through:

1. INSTITUTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE:
   - Provincial government intervention (Zhejiang Provincial Committee work group)
   - Entire hospital department suspended
   - Official medical malpractice appraisal initiated
   - Comparable to accepted articles: Charlie Gard, Alfie Evans, 2018 Chinese vaccine scandal

2. EXTENSIVE COVERAGE:
   - 81+ total sources documented
   - 10 English-language sources (Mothership.sg, Global Times, China Daily, Sixth Tone, City News Service, Layar Hijau)
   - 68+ Chinese domestic sources (major outlets)
   - International petition campaigns

3. PER WP:BIAS:
   Regional Asian coverage demonstrates international interest. Demanding only Western sources creates systemic bias against non-Western topics.

4. LASTING ENCYCLOPEDIC VALUE:
   - Ongoing legal proceedings (not ephemeral news)
   - Institutional changes already implemented
   - Will have definitive legal resolution

Article is well-sourced, neutral, and comparable to existing Wikipedia articles on medical incidents. Recommend KEEP.
```

### STEP 3: Request Community Input

## RESPONSE TEMPLATES FOR COMMON TALK PAGE QUESTIONS

### Q: "Why does this deserve a Wikipedia article?"

A: This case prompted provincial government intervention and the closure of an entire hospital department, indicating institutional significance beyond an individual tragedy. It meets Wikipedia's General Notability Guideline through extensive coverage (81+ sources), institutional response, and ongoing legal proceedings. Comparable Wikipedia articles include Charlie Gard and Alfie Evans.

### Q: "Isn't this just Chinese propaganda?"

A: The article cites multiple independent sources including Mothership.sg (Singapore), Layar Hijau (Indonesia), and Change.org petitions. Chinese state media is properly attributed and used only for official government statements. Per WP:BIAS, regional Asian sources are appropriate for Asian topics. The article maintains strict NPOV and presents facts without advocacy.

### Q: "Why rely on non-English sources?"

A: The incident occurred in China and is primarily documented in Chinese. Major Chinese outlets (The Paper, Sina, Tencent) are reliable sources with editorial standards. English-language sources are included (Mothership, Sixth Tone, Global Times, China Daily, City News Service). The article can expand with Western coverage as it emerges. Per WP:BIAS, requiring only English sources creates systemic bias.

### Q: "Is this article biased against the hospital?"

A: The article maintains strict NPOV. It reports factual claims attributed to sources, presents the hospital's position (statement released though later deleted), and avoids conclusive claims of malpractice (says "appraisal initiated," not "malpractice occurred"). All controversy is documented through reliable sources, not editorialized.

### Q: "Should we wait for the legal case to resolve?"

A: Per WP:NOTNEWS, Wikipedia includes current events if notability is established. The institutional response (department closure, provincial investigation) has already occurred and demonstrates lasting significance. The article will be updated as legal proceedings develop, just as other Wikipedia articles are updated with ongoing developments.
