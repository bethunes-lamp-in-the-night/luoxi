# Death of Xu Luoxi

**Xu Luoxi** (Chinese: 徐洛熙; May 26, 2025 – November 14, 2025) was a five-month-old Chinese infant who died following heart surgery at Ningbo Women & Children's Hospital in Zhejiang Province, China. Luoxi underwent surgery on November 14, 2025, for an atrial septal defect diagnosed by the hospital; she died approximately six hours after the procedure.

An autopsy conducted in December 2025 by forensic pathologist Liu Liang found discrepancies between the hospital's diagnosis and the post-mortem examination, leading the family to allege medical malpractice. According to reports citing the autopsy, the specific type of atrial septal defect that the hospital claimed required immediate surgery was not found, and a surgical patch was discovered inside the heart contrary to medical records. The family rejected financial compensation and launched a social media campaign demanding accountability, which attracted over 290,000 followers on Douyin, China's version of TikTok.

The incident sparked widespread discussion on Chinese social media and attracted support from celebrities including singer Han Hong. In December 2025, Ningbo Women & Children's Hospital suspended operations of its entire pediatric cardiothoracic surgery department, and the Zhejiang Provincial Committee dispatched a work group to oversee the investigation. Multiple articles about the case were removed from Chinese social media platforms, which were subsequently archived by censorship watchdog China Digital Times.

## Background

### Early life

Xu Luoxi was born on May 26, 2025, in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province. During a routine medical examination, doctors detected a heart murmur and diagnosed an atrial septal defect (ASD), a congenital condition where there is a hole between the upper chambers of the heart. The family was referred to Ningbo Women & Children's Hospital for further evaluation and potential treatment.

### Medical history

According to the father's contemporaneous social media posts, Luoxi was admitted to Ningbo Women & Children's Hospital on November 11, 2025, for pre-surgical examinations. The hospital's cardiac team diagnosed a 7-millimeter coronary sinus-type atrial septal defect and recommended immediate surgical intervention. The surgeon reportedly told the parents that the procedure had a 99.5% success rate and was considered "entry-level" surgery that would take less than three hours.

## Medical treatment

### Surgery

On November 14, 2025, at approximately 4:22 PM (16:22), Luoxi underwent heart surgery to repair the diagnosed atrial septal defect. During the operation, which lasted 335 minutes—significantly longer than the promised duration of under three hours—the family was informed that the procedure was "not going smoothly" and that Luoxi's survival probability had dropped to 50%. Later, the family was told that the surgery had been completed successfully and that Luoxi's vital signs were stable.

According to subsequent reporting, a second procedure was performed during the surgery that was not disclosed to the parents either before, during, or after the operation. The extended duration and undisclosed additional procedure were later cited by the family as indicators that the surgery experienced complications that were not fully communicated.

### Death

Luoxi's condition began to deteriorate in the hours following surgery. Her heart rate dropped to 79 beats per minute at 7:50 PM (19:50). Despite medical intervention, Luoxi was pronounced dead at 10:03 PM (22:03), approximately six hours after the surgery began.

Photographs posted by the family show the mother and grandmother seeking help on the street at 11:19 PM, approximately one hour and sixteen minutes after Luoxi's death. In the days following, family members posted images documenting their grief, including a photograph timestamped at 2:05 AM on November 21, 2025—seven days after Luoxi's death—showing the grandmother holding a bottle of breast milk to empty baby clothes.

## Autopsy findings

### Forensic examination

The family requested an autopsy, which was conducted by forensic pathologist Liu Liang and his team. Liu is a prominent Chinese forensic expert who has been involved in several high-profile cases. The autopsy was completed on December 11, 2025, and resulted in a 21-page report.

### Discrepancies with hospital diagnosis

According to news reports citing the autopsy results, forensic examiners did not find evidence of the coronary sinus-type atrial septal defect that the hospital had diagnosed and claimed necessitated immediate surgery. Instead, the autopsy identified only a 3-millimeter secundum-type atrial septal defect. Medical professionals discussing the case on Chinese Q&A platform Zhihu noted that secundum ASDs of this size typically close naturally in more than 80% of cases during the first year of life and generally do not require surgical intervention in infants.

The autopsy also reportedly found a 1.4 × 0.5 centimeter pericardial patch inside the heart, despite medical records indicating that "all patches were removed" during the surgery. Additionally, the examination found that a 6.5-centimeter chest wound and a 5-centimeter pericardial wound had not been sutured closed, and approximately 70 milliliters of blood had accumulated in the chest cavity. The official cause of death was listed as cardiac weakness and respiratory failure.

## Family response

### Rejection of compensation

Following Luoxi's death, Ningbo Women & Children's Hospital reportedly offered the family 10,000 RMB (approximately US$1,400) in compensation. The family rejected this offer. The father publicly stated, "We don't want money, we only want the truth," a position that was widely quoted in Chinese media coverage and became a rallying point for public support.

### Social media campaign

Luoxi's mother created an account on Douyin (China's version of TikTok) under the name @小洛熙妈妈 (Xiao Luoxi's Mother) to document the family's pursuit of accountability. She used the platform to share evidence, including details from the autopsy report, timelines of events, and documentation of the family's interactions with hospital and government officials. The account also featured live-stream videos of the family's attempts to obtain medical records and security footage from the hospital.

The transparency of the family's approach and the compelling nature of the case led to rapid growth in followers. As of December 2025, the mother's account had accumulated 292,769 followers, while the father's Douyin account reached over 141,000 followers. The family's social media presence became a significant factor in maintaining public attention on the case despite censorship efforts.

### Legal actions

On November 21, 2025, one week after Luoxi's death, the father filed a formal complaint with the Ningbo Health Commission requesting an investigation into the circumstances of the death. The family later raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, noting that local health authorities would be investigating a hospital under their own jurisdiction.

On December 28, 2025, the family filed a legal objection alleging that hospital medical records had been systematically falsified. The objection listed five specific allegations of record tampering, including discrepancies regarding the removal of surgical materials and the closure of surgical wounds. The family requested that medical malpractice appraisal be conducted by an independent body with no ties to local Ningbo authorities.

## Public reaction

### Social media discourse

The case generated extensive discussion across multiple Chinese social media platforms, including Douyin, Weibo, Zhihu (a Q&A platform similar to Quora), and Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book). On Zhihu, at least fifteen discussion threads were created about the case, with medical professionals debating the necessity of the surgery and the appropriateness of performing such an operation on a five-month-old infant with a small atrial septal defect.

One Zhihu thread noted that some medical professionals who had initially defended the hospital's actions "reversed positions or went silent" after the autopsy results were published, suggesting that the forensic findings were persuasive even to those within the medical community. The discussions included detailed analysis of international guidelines for atrial septal defect treatment, with some commenters pointing to standards suggesting that observation rather than immediate surgery is typically appropriate for small secundum ASDs in infants.

### Celebrity support

Several prominent Chinese celebrities expressed support for the family's pursuit of accountability, significantly amplifying the case's visibility:

**He Sui**, an international supermodel, was reportedly the first major public figure to speak about the case on November 29, 2025. Her post was described in Chinese media as "firing the first shot" that enabled other celebrities to speak out.

**Han Hong**, one of China's most famous singers and a well-known advocate for medical causes through her charitable work, posted about the case on December 20, 2025, stating: "This case was wrong in such an outrageous way!" (这个案子错得实在是太离谱了！). Han Hong's involvement was particularly significant given her established credibility in medical advocacy and her general reputation for careful, factual commentary on social issues.

**Wang Jinsong**, a prominent Chinese actor, also posted about the case, writing: "Hadn't said 'mama' yet, heaven and humanity outraged" (还没喊一声妈妈，天地不公).

The support from high-profile figures helped sustain public attention and provided a degree of protection against complete censorship, as the deletion of posts from celebrities with millions of followers could itself become a news event.

### Censorship

Multiple articles and social media posts about the Luoxi case were deleted from Chinese platforms. China Digital Times, an organization that monitors internet censorship in China, documented at least four articles that were removed after initial publication:

1. "Commentary: Ningbo Xiao Luoxi Incident - Patients Cannot Become Test Subjects" originally published on the WeChat account 数据开放 (Data Openness)
2. "Autopsy Report Inconsistent with Diagnosis? How Many Questions in Xiao Luoxi Tragedy" by 四环青年 (Fourth Ring Youth)
3. "Why Is No One Talking About How Xiao Luoxi's Initial Ultrasound Was Conducted?" by 竹不倒 (Zhu Bu Dao)
4. Additional articles preserved in China Digital Times' weekly censorship reports

On December 20, 2025, Ningbo Women & Children's Hospital released an official statement responding to the family's publication of autopsy details. The statement defended the hospital's diagnosis and surgical indication, but it was deleted from the hospital's official channels within hours of posting. Hu Xijin, former editor-in-chief of the state-run Global Times newspaper, commented on the deletion, suggesting that removing the statement "is not good" and "transmits additional complex information," implying that the deletion itself raised questions about the hospital's confidence in its position.

Despite these censorship efforts, the family's Douyin account and related discussions remained accessible throughout December 2025 and into January 2026, though with ongoing risk of removal.

## Official response

### Hospital actions

Ningbo Women & Children's Hospital initially maintained that the surgery was medically indicated and performed according to appropriate standards. On December 20, 2025, following the family's publication of autopsy details, the hospital released a statement defending its actions. However, as noted above, this statement was removed from the hospital's official channels within hours.

On December 22, 2025, the hospital announced that its entire pediatric cardiothoracic surgery department would cease operations and all scheduled surgeries would be suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. The closure of an entire department, rather than just disciplinary action against individual doctors, was interpreted by observers as an acknowledgment of potential systemic issues rather than isolated individual error.

### Local investigation

The Ningbo Health Commission conducted an initial investigation into the incident. According to reports in Chinese state media, several hospital officials were subject to administrative discipline, including suspensions and demotions. However, no criminal charges were filed as a result of the local investigation.

The family and public commentators expressed concern that the local investigation might not be fully independent, given that the Ningbo Health Commission has oversight responsibilities for Ningbo Women & Children's Hospital. Questions were raised about whether local authorities might have conflicts of interest that could affect the thoroughness of the investigation.

### Provincial intervention

On December 23, 2025, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party dispatched a work group to Ningbo to oversee a higher-level investigation of the incident. The decision to escalate the matter to the provincial level was seen as a response to sustained public pressure and an implicit acknowledgment that the local investigation had not adequately addressed public concerns.

The provincial work group initiated a formal medical malpractice appraisal process, which as of January 2026 remained ongoing. The involvement of provincial authorities was viewed by some observers as a positive development suggesting that the case would receive more rigorous scrutiny, though others remained skeptical about whether even a provincial investigation would lead to meaningful accountability.

## Broader implications

### Medical reform discourse

The Luoxi case became a focal point for broader discussions about medical safety, informed consent, and patient rights in China. Social media users proposed what some called "Luoxi's Law" (洛熙法案), referring to potential reforms such as:

- Requirements for independent second opinions before pediatric heart surgery
- Stricter informed consent protocols including disclosure of all planned procedures
- Independent medical malpractice appraisal bodies with no local institutional ties
- Severe penalties for falsification of medical records
- Real-time monitoring options for families during surgeries

While no formal legislation had been proposed as of January 2026, the case contributed to ongoing debates about medical system reform in China.

### Medical community response

The case prompted significant discussion within China's medical community about professional standards and the doctor-patient relationship. The shift in opinion among some medical professionals on Zhihu—from initially defending the hospital to questioning the surgical indication after seeing autopsy results—illustrated the persuasive power of forensic evidence in assessing medical decision-making.

Some medical commentators noted that the case highlighted tensions in China's medical system, including pressures on hospitals to perform surgeries (which generate more revenue than conservative observation), inadequate mechanisms for independent oversight, and challenges in the doctor-patient relationship when trust has eroded due to previous scandals.
