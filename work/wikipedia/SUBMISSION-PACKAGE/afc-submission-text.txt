=== Regional Asian Coverage Demonstrates International Interest ===

Per WP:BIAS (systemic bias policy), Wikipedia should not favor Western sources over Asian sources:
- Coverage by Singapore's Mothership.sg (major English-language Asian outlet)
- Coverage by Indonesian Layar Hijau (regional English media)
- International petition campaigns (Change.org, global participation)
- Case occurred in China, Asian sources are geographically appropriate

Demanding only NYT/BBC/CNN coverage creates systemic bias against non-Western topics.
