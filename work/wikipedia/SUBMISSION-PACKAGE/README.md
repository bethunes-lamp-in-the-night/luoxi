## Key Strategic Points

### Why Submit NOW (Not Wait for Western Media)

1. **Mothership.sg provides independent international validation**
   - Singapore independent outlet, NOT Chinese state-controlled
   - Major English-language Asian news outlet
   - Addresses "lack of international sources" concern

2. **Regional Asian coverage sufficient per WP:BIAS**
   - Wikipedia's systemic bias policy argues against requiring only Western sources
   - Layar Hijau (Indonesia) + Mothership (Singapore) = regional interest
   - Demanding NYT/BBC/CNN creates Americentric bias

3. **81+ total sources exceeds typical Wikipedia article**
   - 10 English-language sources
   - 68+ Chinese domestic sources
   - 3 international petitions
   - Exceptionally well-documented

4. **Institutional significance demonstrated**
   - Provincial government intervention
   - Entire hospital department suspended
   - Official medical malpractice appraisal initiated
   - Comparable to accepted Wikipedia articles (Charlie Gard, Alfie Evans)

5. **Time-sensitive (maintain public interest)**
   - Story current and viral now
   - Don't let fade while waiting for Western media
   - Can add NYT/BBC/CNN later if they cover story

### Acceptance Probability: 60-70%

**Factors supporting acceptance:**
- 81+ sources (exceptional documentation)
- Mothership.sg independent international source
- Regional Asian coverage (WP:BIAS defense)
- Institutional significance (provincial response)
- Ultra-conservative NPOV language
- Short length (500 words, low attack surface)
- Proper Wikipedia markup
- Comparable to accepted precedents

**Factors risking rejection:**
- Still lacks major Western outlets (NYT, BBC, CNN)
- Heavy reliance on Chinese domestic sources
- Recent event (though 2+ months passed)
- Reviewer may prefer waiting for legal resolution

**Mitigation:**
- WP:BIAS policy defense prepared
- Mothership.sg emphasis in responses
- Precedent article citations
- Resubmission plan if declined
