== WIKIPEDIA SUBMISSION CHECKLIST ==
Step-by-step instructions for human execution

=== STEP 1: CREATE WIKIPEDIA ACCOUNT (If you don't have one) ===

1. Go to: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CreateAccount
2. Choose a NEUTRAL username
   - Good: "Editor2026", "WikiContributor123", "NeutralEditor"
   - Bad: "LuoxiAdvocate", "JusticeSeeker", "MedicalReform"
   - WHY: Advocacy usernames raise red flags
3. Create account with valid email
4. Verify email address

=== STEP 2: ESTABLISH GOOD FAITH (Important!) ===

Before submitting the Luoxi article, establish yourself as a legitimate editor:

1. Make 5-10 MINOR edits to OTHER articles:
   - Fix typos
   - Add missing citations
   - Update outdated information
   - Improve formatting

2. Focus on NON-CONTROVERSIAL topics:
   - Geography articles
   - Science articles
   - Historical events
   - Avoid: Politics, current events, China-related topics initially

3. Wait 3-7 days before submitting Luoxi article
   - WHY: New accounts submitting controversial topics get extra scrutiny
   - Established accounts have higher acceptance rates

=== STEP 3: CREATE SANDBOX DRAFT ===

1. Go to your user sandbox:
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:[YOUR_USERNAME]/sandbox

2. Click "Edit" tab

3. COPY ENTIRE CONTENTS from:
   work/wikipedia/SUBMISSION-PACKAGE/article-final.txt

4. PASTE into sandbox editor

5. Click "Show preview" button
   - Check that formatting looks correct
   - Check that all citations render properly
   - Check that infobox displays correctly

6. Click "Publish changes" (or "Save page")
   - Add edit summary: "Draft article for AfC submission"

=== STEP 4: OPTIONAL - REQUEST PEER REVIEW (Recommended) ===

This step is OPTIONAL but HIGHLY RECOMMENDED as it improves acceptance rate:

1. Go to WikiProject China talk page:
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_China

2. Create new section:
   Title: "Request for feedback on draft article: Death of Xu Luoxi"

   Message:
   "Hello WikiProject China editors. I have created a draft article on a recent medical incident in China and would appreciate feedback before submitting to AfC. The article is at User:[YOUR_USERNAME]/sandbox and focuses on a case that led to provincial government intervention and hospital department closure. Feedback on sourcing, NPOV, and notability would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

3. Go to WikiProject Medicine talk page:
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine

4. Create similar section requesting medical editor feedback

5. WAIT 3-5 days for responses

6. INCORPORATE reasonable feedback into draft

=== STEP 5: SUBMIT TO ARTICLES FOR CREATION (AfC) ===

1. Go to your sandbox:
   User:[YOUR_USERNAME]/sandbox

2. Click "Edit" tab

3. At the VERY TOP of the page (before the infobox), add this line:
   {{subst:submit}}

4. Click "Publish changes"
   - Edit summary: "Submitting article for AfC review"

5. The {{subst:submit}} template will automatically:
   - Add AfC submission template to page
   - Create submission form
   - Notify AfC reviewers

6. FILL OUT THE SUBMISSION FORM with information from:
   work/wikipedia/SUBMISSION-PACKAGE/afc-submission-text.txt

=== STEP 6: WAIT FOR AFC REVIEWER (1-4 weeks typical) ===

Possible outcomes:
1. ACCEPTED: Article goes live on Wikipedia
2. DECLINED: Reviewer explains reasons, you can address and resubmit
3. NEEDS WORK: Minor issues to fix before resubmission

=== STEP 7: RESPOND TO REVIEWER FEEDBACK ===

If DECLINED or NEEDS WORK:

1. Read reviewer's comments CAREFULLY
2. Do NOT argue emotionally
3. Address specific concerns:

   - If "Not notable":
     Use response from work/wikipedia/SUBMISSION-PACKAGE/reviewer-defense.txt
     Section: OBJECTION 1

   - If "Too many Chinese sources":
     Use response from reviewer-defense.txt
     Section: OBJECTION 2

   - If "Unreliable sources":
     Use response from reviewer-defense.txt
     Section: OBJECTION 3

   - If "Too recent":
     Use response from reviewer-defense.txt

   - If "NPOV concerns":

     Section: OBJECTION 6

4. Make requested changes to article

5. Re-submit by adding {{subst:submit}} again

6. RESPOND TO REVIEWER on the talk page:
   "Thank you for your review. I have addressed [specific concerns] by [specific actions]. Please review again. Thank you."

=== STEP 8: IF ACCEPTED - MONITOR THE ARTICLE ===

Congratulations! Your article is now live. Now:

1. Add article to your WATCHLIST:
   - Click "Watch" star at top of article
   - You'll get notifications of all edits

2. Check article DAILY for first week:
   - Look for vandalism
   - Revert bad-faith edits
   - Engage constructively with good-faith editors

   - Add new information as case develops

4. Respond to TALK PAGE discussions:
   - If someone questions article, respond politely
   - Cite sources and Wikipedia policies
   - Do NOT get into edit wars

5. If article is NOMINATED FOR DELETION (AfD):
   - Go to deletion discussion page
   - Use arguments from reviewer-defense.txt
   - Cite sources demonstrating notability
   - Request input from WikiProject China and WikiProject Medicine
   - Do NOT panic - many articles survive deletion nominations

=== STEP 9: EXPANSION PLAN (Weeks 3-6 after acceptance) ===

Once article has been live for 2-3 weeks with no major disputes:

Phase 2 Expansion:
1. Add autopsy findings section (~150 words)
2. Add family response section (~100 words)
3. Expand celebrity support details (~50 words)
4. Target total: ~700-800 words
5. Add international sources as they emerge

Phase 3 Expansion (Months 2-3):
1. Add censorship documentation section
2. Add medical community response
3. Add legal proceedings updates
4. Target total: 1,500-2,000 words

=== TROUBLESHOOTING ===

PROBLEM: AfC reviewer says "not notable"
SOLUTION: Use OBJECTION 1 response from reviewer-defense.txt
Emphasize: Provincial government intervention, department closure, 81+ sources

PROBLEM: AfC reviewer says "too many Chinese sources"
SOLUTION: Use OBJECTION 2 response from reviewer-defense.txt
Cite WP:BIAS policy, Mothership.sg as independent source

PROBLEM: AfC reviewer says "current event"
SOLUTION: Use OBJECTION 4 response from reviewer-defense.txt
Emphasize institutional impact, ongoing legal case, precedent articles

PROBLEM: Someone nominates article for deletion
SOLUTION:
1. Go to deletion discussion page
2. Vote "Keep" with policy arguments
3. Cite sources and precedent articles
4. Request input from WikiProject China/Medicine
5. Use full reviewer-defense.txt arguments

PROBLEM: Edit war breaks out
SOLUTION:
1. Do NOT engage in revert war (max 3 reverts per day or you get blocked)
2. Go to article Talk page
3. Start discussion: "Let's discuss this edit before making changes"
4. Seek consensus
5. If no consensus, request admin mediation

=== TIMELINE ESTIMATE ===

Week 1: Create account, establish good faith (5-10 minor edits)
Week 2: Create sandbox draft, request peer review
Week 3: Incorporate feedback, submit to AfC
Week 4-7: Wait for AfC review (1-4 weeks typical)
Week 8+: Article live, begin monitoring and expansion

TOTAL TIME: 2-3 months from account creation to stable article

=== IMPORTANT REMINDERS ===

1. BE PATIENT: Wikipedia is volunteer-run, reviews take time
2. BE POLITE: Never argue rudely with reviewers or editors
3. BE NEUTRAL: Always maintain NPOV, even when frustrated
4. BE PERSISTENT: If declined, address concerns and resubmit
5. BE RESPONSIVE: Respond to reviewer questions within 24-48 hours
6. BE COLLABORATIVE: Wikipedia is about consensus, not winning
