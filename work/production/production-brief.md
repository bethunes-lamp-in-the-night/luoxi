# Production Brief - Luoxi Case Content Creation

**Created:** January 14, 2026
**Agent:** M4.0 - Production Brief Creator
**Purpose:** Consolidated Phase 2 + Phase 3 intelligence for content production agents (M4.1-M4.6)
**Status:** PRODUCTION READY

---

## SECTION 1: MISSION & CONSTRAINTS

### Mission Statement

Create viral social media content that reaches 500K-1M people in first month, generates 1-2 journalist articles by Week 4-8, and establishes Wikipedia presence by Week 8-12. Primary path: Viral social → Mainstream media → Authority response.

### Critical Constraints

**BUDGET REALITY:**
- **Total budget:** $200 (CEO directive)
- **Week 1-4 budget:** $0 (100% organic)
- **Month 2-3 budget:** $200 IF content proves viral (50K+ views threshold)
- **Zero-budget assumption:** All production must work with free tools only

**HUMAN RESOURCES:**
- **1 human worker** (CEO coordination role)
- **Time budget:** 16-21 hours/week for content production (Week 1)
- **Skills assumption:** Zero professional video editing experience
- **Tools available:** Free tier only (CapCut, Canva Free, Google Docs)

**TIMELINE:**
- **3-month window** (January-April 2026)
- **2-4 week Western media window** before censorship hardens
- **Week 1 critical** (first content must perform or pivot needed)

### Success Metrics

**Phase 1 (Week 1-4):**
- 500K-1M total reach across platforms
- 50K-150K views on best-performing single video (Week 1)
- 1-2 journalist responses (out of 10 contacted)
- 500-1,500 new followers/subscribers

**Phase 2 (Week 5-8):**
- 1-2 journalist articles published (regional/niche outlets minimum)
- Wikipedia article submitted (acceptance Week 8-12)
- Sustained engagement (not just viral burst then fade)

**Phase 3 (Week 9-12):**
- Wikipedia article live (adds credibility/permanence)
- Ongoing legal case updates sustain interest
- Community established (not just passive viewers)

### What We're Fighting

**Time decay:** Story is 2 months old (Nov 14 death), freshness advantage fading
**Censorship:** 4+ articles already deleted, family accounts vulnerable
**Resource limits:** $200 budget vs. typical PR campaigns ($5K-50K)
**China fatigue:** Western audiences may have "China bad" story fatigue
**Translation barriers:** 95% of evidence in Chinese, requires translation work

---

## SECTION 2: THE 8 WESTERN VIRAL ANGLES

### Overview

Phase 2 developed 8 viral narrative angles optimized for Western audiences. Phase 3 ranked them by viral coefficient (1-10 scale) based on algorithmic mechanics analysis. **Focus on top 3 for Week 1 production.**

---

### ANGLE 3: "Grandmother Feeding Empty Clothes at 2 AM" — 10/10 VIRAL POTENTIAL

**THE ASSET:** Photo of grandmother at 2:05 AM, Nov 21, holding breast milk bottle to baby's empty folded clothes

**Story Hook:**
"November 21, 2025. 2:05 AM. A grandmother sits on a bed, holding a bottle of breast milk to empty baby clothes. Seven days earlier, her granddaughter was alive."

**Why 10/10 Viral Score:**
- Requires ZERO context—image is universally devastating
- Silent scream (no translation needed)
- Grandparent grief transcends all cultures
- Timestamp proof (2:05 AM) makes it undeniably real
- Comparable to Tank Man, Aylan Kurdi—images that transcend language

**Emotional Arc:**
Confusion (what am I seeing?) → Recognition (oh no) → Devastating empathy → Rage (this was preventable) → Action (must share)

**Platform Recommendations:**
- **PRIMARY:** Instagram (visual-first platform, carousel for context)
- **SECONDARY:** TikTok (15-30 second silent video, text overlays only)
- **TERTIARY:** X/Twitter (single image with minimal caption)

**Production Time:** 5-7 hours (shortest—single photo, simple text overlays)

**Expected Performance (Week 1):**
- Conservative: 5K-15K views
- Target: 30K-80K views
- Optimistic: 200K-500K views (grandmother photo goes VIRAL)

**Supporting Evidence:**
- FACT #2: Grandmother feeding empty clothes (Photo V005, timestamped)
- FACT #5: 99.5% success → death in 6 hours (provides context)
- FACT #1: Surgery for disease that didn't exist (preventability)

**Hook Formulas (TikTok 3-second rule):**
- "What is this woman doing at 2 AM?" [pause] "Seven days earlier, her granddaughter was alive."
- [Silent photo hold for 2 seconds, then text: "2:05 AM"]
- "This is grief."

---

### ANGLE 1: "The 99.5% Surgery That Killed a Baby" — 8/10 VIRAL POTENTIAL

**Story Hook:**
"A surgeon promised 99.5% success for 'routine' baby heart surgery. 6 hours later, the baby was dead. Then the autopsy revealed what really happened."

**Core Narrative (60 seconds):**
- 5-month-old Luoxi, heart murmur detected
- Doctor: "99.5% success, routine procedure, under 3 hours"
- Parents trust, sign consent, kiss baby goodbye
- 3 hours pass. Then 4. Then 5. Then 6.
- Told "successful" at 4:30 PM
- Baby dies at 10:03 PM
- **TWIST:** Autopsy reveals condition requiring surgery NEVER EXISTED
- Hospital diagnosed 7mm defect → Autopsy found NONE (only 3mm hole that heals naturally 80%+)
- Worse: Surgical patch LEFT INSIDE heart (records say "all removed")
- Worse still: 6.5cm chest wound NOT SEWN CLOSED
- Hospital offers $1,400 → Parents: "We don't want money. We only want the truth."

**Why 8/10 Viral Score:**
- Perfect blend: Emotional story + Documentary proof + Clear villain
- Documentary evidence depoliticizes (not "he said/she said")
- Universal fear: Trusting doctors who lie
- Comparable to Charlie Gard, Alfie Evans cases (10M+ international reach)

**Emotional Arc:**
Trust (doctor promises) → Anxiety (surgery too long) → Relief (told successful) → Devastation (death) → Betrayal (autopsy reveals lies) → Rage (cover-up) → Hope (parents fighting)

**Platform Recommendations:**
- **PRIMARY:** TikTok (60-sec timeline format, pattern interrupts at 15s/30s)
- **SECONDARY:** YouTube (10-15 min documentary deep dive)
- **TERTIARY:** X/Twitter (15-tweet thread with evidence progression)

**Production Time:** 8-12 hours (TikTok 60-sec), 20-30 hours (YouTube long-form)

**Expected Performance (Week 1):**
- Conservative: 8K-20K views
- Target: 25K-60K views
- Optimistic: 100K-250K views + medical professional engagement

**Supporting Evidence:**
- FACT #5: 99.5% success → death in 6 hours
- FACT #1: Surgery for disease that didn't exist (autopsy vs. diagnosis)
- FACT #3: Surgical patch left inside heart
- FACT #4: 6.5cm wound unsutured
- FACT #8: Only 3mm defect—80%+ heal naturally
- FACT #16: "We only want truth, not money"

**Visual Assets:**
- Photo V003: Before/after compilation (70/70 viral score)
- Photo V005: Grandmother feeding clothes (emotional anchor)
- Autopsy report Tab 3 (key pages translated)

**Hook Formulas:**
- "A surgeon promised 99.5% success. The baby died. Here's why."
- "What if hospitals were performing unnecessary surgeries for profit?"
- "This doctor lied. The autopsy proved it."

**Pattern Interrupts (Critical for 60-sec retention):**
- 0:13 mark: "But here's what the autopsy found..." [quick cut, color shift]
- 0:30 mark: "The baby died 6 hours after surgery" [emotional photo, text on red bar]

---

### ANGLE 7: "Remember Her Name: Luoxi" — 8/10 VIRAL POTENTIAL

**Story Hook:**
"She was 5 months old. She had her whole life ahead. Her name was Luoxi. Don't let them erase her."

**Core Narrative (30 seconds):**
- [Photo: Smiling baby Luoxi]
- This is Luoxi
- She loved when her grandmother sang to her
- She was just starting to laugh
- She never got to say "mama"
- On November 14, 2025, she went to the hospital for a routine checkup
- She never came home
- A doctor lied. A surgery was unnecessary. A baby died.
- Now authorities want this story to disappear
- But we won't let them
- Say her name: Luoxi (洛熙)
- Share her story. Remember her.
- Every share defeats erasure.

**Why 8/10 Viral Score:**
- Simplicity—transcends politics, pure humanity
- Memorial movements work (#SayHerName from Black Lives Matter)
- Annual hook potential (November 14 remembrance)
- Becomes campaign identity/hashtag consolidation

**Emotional Arc:**
Tenderness (baby photos) → Loss (she's gone) → Injustice (preventable) → Resistance (won't forget) → Action (remembrance = resistance)

**Platform Recommendations:**
- **PRIMARY:** Instagram (memorial post with clean aesthetic)
- **SECONDARY:** TikTok (15-30 sec photo slideshow, gentle music)
- **TERTIARY:** Dedicated memorial website (RememberLuoxi.org)

**Production Time:** 6-8 hours (memorial post design + TikTok version)

**Expected Performance (Week 1):**
- Conservative: 3K-10K views
- Target: 12K-35K views
- Optimistic: 50K-150K views (memorial angle hits broad resonance)

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Baby photos (smiling, healthy—before tragedy)
- Timeline: May 26 (birth) → Nov 14 (death)
- Family quotes: "Haven't said 'mama' yet"
- Memorial items: Hair clips, clothes, milk bottle at 2 AM

**Visual Assets:**
- Photos V024-V025: Happy baby, mother's tender care
- Photo V016: Hair clips detail ("Hair clips mom bought were finally put on today")
- Photo V005: Grandmother feeding clothes (emotional anchor)

**Hook Formulas:**
- "Her name was Luoxi. She was 5 months old. Say her name."
- "How many babies die from unnecessary procedures? This is Luoxi."
- "Don't let her be forgotten."

**Strategic Use:**
This angle should be woven through ALL content as humanizing thread. Never just "a baby"—always "Luoxi."

---

### ANGLE 2: "What They Don't Want You To See" — 7/10 VIRAL POTENTIAL

**Story Hook:**
"A baby died after fraudulent surgery in China. The hospital deleted their statement. News articles vanished overnight. Here's what they're trying to hide."

**Core Narrative (45 seconds):**
- November 14: Baby Luoxi dies after unnecessary heart surgery
- December 19: Family publishes autopsy—goes viral
- December 20: Hospital posts response, then DELETES it hours later
- December 21: Four major news articles censored and deleted
- But the internet never forgets
- Archived evidence shows: false diagnosis, patch left inside baby's heart, records falsified
- Mother goes live on Chinese TikTok—290,000 people watch authorities squirm
- Provincial government FORCED to intervene
- Entire cardiac department SHUT DOWN
- Message: Share before it's deleted. Truth can't be censored if we all tell it.

**Why 7/10 Viral Score:**
- Strong for Western audiences (anti-censorship angle)
- "Forbidden knowledge" hook (irresistible click)
- Risk: Could seem political rather than human without careful framing

**Emotional Arc:**
Curiosity (forbidden) → Outrage (censorship proof) → Satisfaction (evidence preserved) → Empowerment (collective action works) → Urgency (share before deleted)

**Platform Recommendations:**
- **PRIMARY:** X/Twitter (thread with archived screenshots, deletion evidence)
- **SECONDARY:** TikTok/Instagram ("Things they deleted" series)
- **TERTIARY:** Reddit (r/China, r/JusticeServed with archived links)

**Production Time:** 10-12 hours (screenshot compilation, archive documentation)

**Expected Performance (Week 1):**
- Conservative: 10K-25K impressions (Twitter reach metric)
- Target: 50K-100K impressions
- Optimistic: 500K-1M impressions (trending hashtag)

**Supporting Evidence:**
- FACT #10: Hospital deleted statement same day
- FACT #15: Multiple censored articles archived (China Digital Times)
- FACT #14: Mother's 290K+ Douyin followers
- FACT #13: Provincial intervention (proof pressure worked)
- FACT #11: Entire cardiac department shut down

**Visual Assets:**
- Screenshot: Hospital statement before deletion
- Screenshot: CDT 404 archive page
- Screenshot: Mother's follower count
- Photo V001: Mother begging "Don't hit us"
- Photo V002: Police confrontation

**Hook Formulas:**
- "China is deleting this story. Here's what they don't want you to know."
- "This hospital posted this statement, then deleted it hours later. We have receipts."
- "Share before this gets taken down."

**Best Used As:** Secondary angle after Angles 1/3 establish credibility (Week 2-3, not Week 1 lead)

---

### ANGLE 5: "290,000 Parents vs. The System—And They're Winning" — 7/10 VIRAL POTENTIAL

**Story Hook:**
"A baby died from medical fraud. Her mother went live on Chinese TikTok. Now 290,000 people are watching authorities squirm. And it's working."

**Core Narrative (45 seconds):**
- November 14: Luoxi dies after fraudulent surgery
- Hospital offers $1,400 to silence family
- Parents refuse: "We don't want money. We only want truth."
- Mother starts live-streaming on Douyin (Chinese TikTok)
- Shows evidence. Answers questions. Posts in real-time.
- Authorities try to pressure her to stop
- She keeps going
- 100,000 followers. Then 200,000. Then 290,000.
- December 23: Provincial government FORCED to intervene
- December 22: Entire cardiac department SHUT DOWN
- Proof that grassroots pressure works
- One mother with a phone changed everything
- Your voice matters. Your shares matter. Justice is possible.

**Why 7/10 Viral Score:**
- Empowering (shows activism works, not just outrage)
- Platform meta-interest (TikTok story on TikTok)
- Risk: Requires more context than pure emotional angles

**Emotional Arc:**
Despair (family alone) → Courage (mother refuses silence) → Hope (followers grow) → Victory (authorities act) → Empowerment (we can do this too)

**Platform Recommendations:**
- **PRIMARY:** TikTok (meta-activism—TikTok story about TikTok)
- **SECONDARY:** LinkedIn (case study for organizers)
- **TERTIARY:** Podcasts (activism tactics discussion)

**Production Time:** 10-14 hours (requires follower count graphics, timeline visualization)

**Expected Performance (Week 1):**
- Conservative: 5K-15K views
- Target: 20K-50K views
- Optimistic: 80K-150K views (activist communities amplify)

**Supporting Evidence:**
- FACT #14: Mother's 290K+ Douyin followers (specific: 292,769)
- FACT #13: Provincial intervention Dec 23 (39 days of pressure working)

- Photo V001: Mother's defiance "I'll fight them"

**Hook Formulas:**
- "This mom used TikTok to take on a corrupt hospital. And she won."
- "290,000 people are watching. The government had to respond."
- "Your voice can make a difference. Here's proof."

**Best Used As:** Week 2-3 content to SUSTAIN campaign after initial breakthrough (not Week 1 lead)

---

### ANGLES 4, 6, 8: DEFERRED TO MONTH 2-3 (Lower Priority)

**ANGLE 4:** "The Hospital That Kills Babies for Profit" — 6/10 viral potential
**Reason to defer:** Profit motive is speculative, requires more evidence, risk of conspiracy-theory framing
**Use when:** After credibility established, if pattern evidence emerges

**ANGLE 6:** "The International Medical Community Must Speak" — 5/10 viral potential
**Reason to defer:** Too clinical for general audiences, slower burn (months not weeks)
**Use when:** Targeting #MedTwitter, medical journals, professional accountability angle

**ANGLE 8:** "Could This Happen Where You Live?" — 6/10 viral potential
**Reason to defer:** Requires research on hospital partnerships, narrow audience (specific medical schools)
**Use when:** After initial viral success, for institutional pressure campaign

## SECTION 4: PLATFORM-SPECIFIC VIRAL MECHANICS

### TikTok/Instagram Reels (PRIMARY PLATFORM WEEK 1)

**Why TikTok First:**
- Fastest viral velocity (0-50K views in 24 hours possible)
- FYP algorithm pushes emotion-driven content organically ($0 cost)
- Short-form video matches attention span for complex story
- Grandmother photo is MADE for TikTok's visual-first format

**FYP Algorithm Triggers (Reverse-Engineered):**

**1. Completion Rate (Most Important):**
- Video must be watched to end (60%+ completion = FYP push)
- **Strategy:** Start with 15-20 second videos (easier to complete)
- **Hook rule:** First 3 seconds must create confusion/intrigue (not explanation)
- **Example:** Show grandmother photo with NO context for 2 seconds → viewer tries to understand → keeps watching

**2. Pattern Interrupts (Retention Checkpoints):**
- **15-second mark:** 50% of viewers drop off here—MUST have visual/emotional interrupt
- **Example:** Angle 1 (60-sec video) at 0:13 → "But here's what the autopsy found..." [color shift, quick cut]
- **30-second mark:** Second drop-off point—another interrupt needed
- **Example:** At 0:30 → Emotional photo + text on red bar (funeral visual cue)

**3. Engagement Velocity (Likes/Comments/Shares in First Hour):**
- First hour performance signals algorithm to push or suppress
- **Strategy:** Post at optimal times (Tuesday 7pm EST, Sunday 6pm EST)
- **Boost tactics:** Respond to first 10 comments within minutes (signals engagement)

**4. Watch-Through vs. Swipe-Away Ratio:**
- High swipe-away in first 3 seconds = algorithm suppresses
- **Strategy:** SILENT videos often perform better (no audio expectations to disappoint)
- **Example:** Grandmother photo needs NO music—silence is more haunting

**5. Shares to Outside-App:**
- TikTok prioritizes content shared to Instagram, WhatsApp, Messages (not just TikTok DMs)
- **Strategy:** Clear CTA in caption—"Share this before it's deleted"

**Production Specifics (Copy from week-1-scripts.md):**

**VIDEO 1: Grandmother Photo (20 seconds)**
- 0:00-0:03: Photo with NO TEXT (confusion hook)
- 0:03-0:05: "2:05 AM" appears
- 0:05-0:10: "Seven days after"
- 0:10-0:15: "her granddaughter died"
- 0:15-0:18: "#JusticeForLuoxi"
- **Audio:** SILENT (no music, no voiceover)
- **Expected time:** 5-7 hours production

**VIDEO 2: 99.5% Surgery (60 seconds)**
- Pattern interrupts at 0:13 and 0:30 marks (CRITICAL)
- 16 text overlays total (staggered reveals, not all at once)
- Optional sad piano music at 30-40% volume
- **Expected time:** 8-12 hours production

**VIDEO 3: Remember Luoxi (30 seconds)**
- Memorial tone (gentle music, slow fades)
- Focus on life before tragedy (happy baby photos)
- Text-on-black at 0:13 for pattern interrupt
- **Expected time:** 6-8 hours production

**Posting Schedule Week 1:**
- **Tuesday 7pm EST:** Video 1 (Grandmother photo)
- **Sunday 6pm EST:** Video 2 (99.5% surgery)
- **Thursday 7pm EST:** Video 3 (Remember Luoxi) OR hold for Week 2 depending on Video 1-2 performance

**Success Thresholds:**
- 10K+ views in 48 hours = Continue to Week 2
- 50K+ views in 48 hours = Increase production (2-3 more videos Week 2)
- <5K views in 48 hours = Pivot (test different format, length, or platform)

---

### YouTube Shorts (SECONDARY PLATFORM WEEK 2-3)

**Why YouTube Shorts Second (Not Week 1):**
- Slower viral velocity than TikTok (2-7 days vs. 24 hours)
- Algorithm rewards consistency (posting 3-5 Shorts builds channel momentum)
- BUT: Longer shelf life (Shorts discovered weeks/months later)

**Swipe Velocity Algorithm:**
- YouTube measures "swipe to next Short" vs. "watch multiple times"
- **Strategy:** End Shorts with question or cliffhanger ("Part 2 in bio")
- **Hook:** First frame must be visually distinct (thumbnail psychology)

**Title Formulas (SEO-Optimized):**
- "Baby Died from Unnecessary Surgery | The Luoxi Case"
- "What This Autopsy Revealed Will Shock You | Medical Malpractice"
- "Grandmother's Grief at 2 AM | Remember Luoxi"

**Thumbnail Psychology (Even for Shorts):**
- High contrast (dark background, bright subject)
- Text overlay: 3-5 words MAX ("THE AUTOPSY PROVED IT")
- Emotional face if available (grandmother, crying mother)

**Production Strategy:**
- Repurpose TikTok Videos 1-3 (upload same content to YouTube Shorts)
- Add SEO-optimized title + description
- Test: TikTok version vs. YouTube Shorts performance comparison

---

### X/Twitter (JOURNALIST OUTREACH PLATFORM WEEK 1)

**Why Twitter Critical:**
- Journalists check Twitter for story leads (not TikTok)
- Threads allow detailed evidence presentation (TikTok = emotion, Twitter = facts)
- Hashtag trends can force mainstream media coverage

**Thread Structures That Work:**

**OPTION A: Timeline Thread (15 tweets)**
1. Hook + photo ("A surgeon promised 99.5% success. The baby died.")
2-10. Timeline with facts (Nov 11 admission → Nov 14 death → Dec 19 autopsy)
11-13. Evidence (autopsy findings, hospital deletion, department closure)
14. Call to action ("Journalists: Why isn't Western media covering this?")
15. Resources (fact sheet link, petition, #JusticeForLuoxi)

**OPTION B: Evidence-First Thread (10 tweets)**
1. "The autopsy proved the hospital lied. Here's the evidence. 🧵"
2. Hospital claimed: 7mm defect requiring surgery
3. Autopsy found: NO such defect (only 3mm, heals naturally)
4. Records said: "All patches removed"
5. Autopsy found: 1.4cm patch INSIDE heart
6. Records said: Wounds sutured
7. Autopsy found: 6.5cm chest wound UNSUTURED
8. Hospital response: Posted statement, deleted same day
9. Government response: Closed ENTIRE cardiac department
10. "290,000 people in China know this story. Zero Western journalists covering it. Why?"

**Journalist Targeting Strategy:**
- Tag 5-10 journalists per thread (medical reporters, China correspondents)
- Examples: @propublica, @statnews, @nytimeshealth
- Post at 9am EST Tuesday-Thursday (when journalists check Twitter)

**Hashtag Recommendations:**
- **Campaign tags:** #JusticeForLuoxi, #RememberLuoxi (build consolidation)
- **Discovery tags:** #MedicalMalpractice, #PatientRights, #HealthcareReform
- **Journalist tags:** #MedTwitter, #Journalism, #InvestigativeJournalism

**Expected Performance:**
- Conservative: 10K-30K impressions
- Target: 50K-150K impressions
- Optimistic: 500K-1M impressions (trending hashtag)

**Conversion Goal:**
- 1-2 journalists respond asking for materials (Week 1-2)
- 1 journalist article published (Week 4-8)

---

### Reddit (ORGANIC SEEDING WEEK 1)

**Why Reddit:**
- Longer-form content tolerance (1,000-2,000 word posts work)
- Community-driven amplification (upvotes = visibility, not algorithm)
- If post hits 1K+ upvotes, journalists may contact YOU organically

**Target Subreddits (Week 1):**

**PRIMARY: r/MedicalMalpractice (or similar):**
- Post title: "Baby died from unnecessary surgery in China. Autopsy contradicts hospital diagnosis. 290K people following case but zero Western media coverage."
- Format: Detailed post with timeline, evidence, links to sources
- Include: "I have fact sheet for journalists interested in covering this"

**SECONDARY: r/China:**
- Post title: "Ningbo hospital closes cardiac surgery department after baby's death. Autopsy revealed surgery was unnecessary."
- Format: Focus on systemic angle (entire department closed = pattern)
- Avoid: Anti-China political framing (will get downvoted)

**TERTIARY: r/JusticeServed (if content fits):**
- Post title: "Mother builds 290K followers, forces provincial government to intervene after hospital kills baby with fraudulent surgery"
- Format: David vs. Goliath success story
- Angle: Grassroots activism WORKS (empowering narrative)

**Posting Best Practices:**
- Original poster must engage in comments (respond to top 20 comments in first 2 hours)
- Provide sources in comments (not just claims)
- Avoid: Asking for upvotes (against Reddit rules, post will be removed)

**Expected Performance:**
- Conservative: 100-500 upvotes
- Target: 1K-3K upvotes
- Optimistic: 10K+ upvotes (front page of subreddit)

**Conversion Goal:**
- Reddit post reaches journalists organically (monitor DMs)
- Community members share to other platforms (Twitter, Facebook groups)

---

### Instagram (VISUAL STORYTELLING WEEK 2-3)

**Why Instagram Week 2 (Not Week 1):**
- Instagram Reels algorithm slower than TikTok
- Better for polished, aesthetic content (needs more production time)
- Carousel posts allow deeper storytelling (10 slides)

**Content Formats:**

**FORMAT 1: Carousel Post (10 slides)**
- Slide 1: Hook image (grandmother photo or before/after)
- Slide 2: "This is Luoxi"
- Slides 3-8: Timeline with facts (one fact per slide, visual + text)
- Slide 9: Call to action ("Share her story")
- Slide 10: #RememberLuoxi + resources link

**FORMAT 2: Reels (Repurpose TikTok Videos)**
- Upload TikTok Videos 1-3 to Instagram Reels
- Change caption to Instagram-optimized (longer captions work on IG)
- Add more hashtags (Instagram allows 30, TikTok best at 3-5)

**Caption Strategy:**
- Instagram allows 2,200 characters (use it—tell full story in caption)
- First sentence must hook (shown in feed preview)
- Break into scannable paragraphs (line breaks every 2-3 sentences)

**Hashtag Recommendations (Use 20-30):**
- #JusticeForLuoxi, #RememberLuoxi
- #MedicalMalpractice, #PatientRights, #HealthcareReform
- #GriefHasNoWords, #NeverForget, #SayHerName
- #ParentsOfInstagram, #MomsOfIG, #GrandparentsLove
- #China, #MedicalEthics, #TruthMatters

## SECTION 5: CONTENT PRODUCTION STRATEGY

### Week 1 Focus: TikTok Priority (3 Videos)

**Why Start with TikTok:**
- Fastest viral feedback loop (know if content works in 24-48 hours)
- Lowest production barrier (3 videos = 16-21 hours total, doable in 1 week)
- Free tools sufficient (CapCut mobile app)

**Production Order (Prioritized by Speed + Viral Potential):**

**VIDEO 1: Grandmother Photo (Angle 3) — PRODUCE FIRST**
- **Why first:** Shortest production time (5-7 hours), highest viral potential (10/10)
- **Timeline:** Monday research/setup, Tuesday production, Tuesday 7pm post
- **Asset needs:** Single photo (V005), text overlays only, no music
- **Tools:** CapCut mobile app (free) OR TikTok native editor
- **Success threshold:** 10K+ views in 48 hours = proceed to Video 2

**VIDEO 2: 99.5% Surgery (Angle 1) — PRODUCE SECOND**
- **Why second:** If Video 1 succeeds (10K+), audience wants more context/facts
- **Timeline:** Wednesday-Thursday production (8-12 hours), Sunday 6pm post
- **Asset needs:** 4-6 photos (baby, autopsy, grandmother), text overlays, optional music
- **Tools:** CapCut desktop (free) for more control on 60-sec timeline
- **Success threshold:** 15K+ views in 48 hours = evidence angle resonates

**VIDEO 3: Remember Luoxi (Angle 7) — PRODUCE THIRD**
- **Why third:** Memorial angle works better once audience knows story (Videos 1-2)
- **Timeline:** Thursday-Friday production (6-8 hours), post Thursday Week 1 OR Tuesday Week 2
- **Asset needs:** 3-4 photos (baby smiling, memorial), gentle music, text overlays
- **Tools:** CapCut desktop with memorial music from TikTok Sound Library
- **Success threshold:** 8K+ views + high comment quality ("Remember Luoxi" text) = campaign identity established

**Total Week 1 Time Budget:** 20-27 hours (realistic for 1 human with zero video editing experience + learning curve)

---

### Week 2-4 Strategy: Multi-Platform Expansion IF TikTok Succeeds

**Decision Point: End of Week 1 (Wednesday after Video 3 posts)**

**IF Videos 1-3 Total Views >50K:**
- **Action:** Scale TikTok (produce 2-3 more videos Week 2 using winning angle)
- **Expand to:** Instagram Reels (repurpose TikTok content), YouTube Shorts (same)
- **Invest:** $50-100 on TikTok Spark Ads for best-performing video (boost proven winner)

**IF Videos 1-3 Total Views 20K-50K:**
- **Action:** Continue TikTok (1-2 more videos Week 2), test format variations
- **Expand to:** X/Twitter threads (evidence-based, target journalists)
- **Hold:** Instagram/YouTube expansion until Week 3 (don't spread too thin)

**IF Videos 1-3 Total Views <20K:**
- **Action:** PIVOT—test new formats (voiceover vs. text, 15s vs. 60s, different angles)
- **Or:** Shift focus to Reddit + journalist outreach (TikTok algorithm may not favor topic)
- **Or:** Increase production quality (hire freelancer on Fiverr for $50-100?)

---

### Budget Allocation: $0 Organic, $200 for Proven Winners ONLY

**Week 1-4 Budget: $0**
- ALL tools free tier (CapCut, Canva Free, Google Docs, Gmail)
- ALL distribution organic (no paid ads)
- Time investment only (16-21 hours/week)

**Month 2 Budget: $0-200 (Conditional)**

**Scenario A: TikTok video hits 50K+ views**
- Spend $100-150 on TikTok Spark Ads (boost proven winner to 200K-500K views)
- Expected ROI: $100 = 30K-50K additional reach
- Threshold: Only spend if organic performance proves content works

**Scenario B: Journalist article published (Week 4-8)**
- Spend $50-100 on promoted tweets linking to article (amplify credibility)
- Expected ROI: Mainstream media = validation = easier organic growth

**Scenario C: Videos underperform (<20K total Week 1-4)**
- Hold $200 budget
- Option: Hire freelance video editor on Fiverr ($50-150) to upgrade production quality
- Option: Paid PR distribution (PRWeb $100-200) to reach journalist databases
- Option: Micro-influencer outreach ($50-100 per post, but low priority)

**CEO Constraint Reminder:** Budget is for PROVEN winners only, not speculation. Don't spend $200 hoping content goes viral—wait for organic traction FIRST.

### Time Budget Reality Check (1 Human Worker)

**Week 1 Breakdown (Realistic 21-hour estimate):**

| Task | Hours | Day |
|------|-------|-----|
| Download CapCut, learn basics | 2 | Monday |
| Gather assets (photos, translate key text) | 2 | Monday |
| Produce Video 1 (Grandmother) | 5-7 | Monday-Tuesday |
| Post Video 1, monitor first hour | 1 | Tuesday 7pm |
| Respond to top comments (engagement boost) | 1 | Tuesday 8-10pm |
| Produce Video 2 (99.5% surgery) | 8-12 | Wednesday-Thursday |
| Post Video 2, monitor, respond | 1 | Sunday 6pm |
| Produce Video 3 (Remember Luoxi) | 6-8 | Thursday-Friday |
| Journalist outreach (research + 10 emails) | 5 | Tuesday-Friday |
| Reddit post (1-2 subreddits) | 2 | Wednesday |
| **TOTAL** | **33-42 hours** | **Week 1** |

**REALITY CHECK:** 33-42 hours is NOT realistic for 1 human worker in 1 week (40-hour workweek).

**REVISED PRIORITY (CEO Decision Needed):**

**OPTION A: Focus ONLY on Video 1 + Journalist Outreach Week 1**
- Produce Video 1 (8 hours including learning curve)
- Journalist outreach (5 hours)
- Monitor Video 1 performance (2 hours)
- **Total: 15 hours** (realistic for Week 1)
- Produce Videos 2-3 ONLY if Video 1 succeeds (Week 2-3)

**OPTION B: Prioritize Journalist Outreach + X/Twitter Over TikTok**
- Journalist outreach (5 hours)
- X/Twitter threads (3 hours for 2-3 threads)
- Reddit posts (2 hours)
- Skip video production Week 1 (higher ROI on journalist article than TikTok video)
- **Total: 10 hours** (most realistic for Week 1)

**OPTION C: Hire Freelance Video Editor ($50-150)**
- Human does: Asset gathering, script writing, journalist outreach (8 hours)
- Freelancer does: Video editing/production (Videos 1-3 in 1 week)
- **Budget impact:** $50-150 spent Week 1 (reduces Month 2 budget to $50-150)
- **Pros:** All 3 videos produced Week 1, human focuses on higher-ROI journalist work
- **Cons:** Reduces budget flexibility Month 2

**RECOMMENDATION:** Option A (Video 1 + Journalists Week 1). Test if TikTok works BEFORE investing 20+ hours in Videos 2-3.

---

## SECTION 6: GROWTH & DISTRIBUTION

### Journalist Outreach (HIGHEST ROI WEEK 1)

**Why Journalist Outreach is Priority #1:**
- 10-15% response rate (vs. 2-5% for influencers)
- 1 article = 10-100x more credibility than influencer post
- Articles are permanent, SEO-optimized, cited by others
- Articles unblock Wikipedia submission (need 2-3 independent sources)
- ROI: 5 hours → 1-2 responses → 0-1 article (Week 4-8) → 100K-500K readership + Wikipedia unblocked

**10 Journalist Targets (Week 1):**

**TIER 1: Medical/Health Reporters (3 contacts)**
1. STAT News medical ethics reporter
2. ProPublica healthcare investigation reporter
3. Freelance medical journalist (Twitter search: "medical journalist" + "freelance")

**TIER 2: China Correspondents (3 contacts)**
4. The Guardian China correspondent
5. NPR Asia correspondent
6. Reuters Asia health correspondent

**TIER 3: Regional Asia Outlets (2 contacts)**
7. South China Morning Post (SCMP) health reporter
8. The Diplomat China/health correspondent

**TIER 4: Medical Ethics Specialists (2 contacts)**
9. Hastings Center bioethicist/writer
10. Medical ethics podcast producer

**Email Template (Personalized per journalist):**

Subject: Story tip - Baby died from unnecessary surgery, autopsy proves hospital fraud (zero Western coverage)

---

Hi [Name],

I've been following your reporting on [specific article they wrote on medical safety/ethics].

I'm documenting a case in China where a 5-month-old baby died from heart surgery. The autopsy revealed the hospital misdiagnosed the condition—the defect that required "urgent" surgery didn't exist. The surgeon promised 99.5% success.

Zero Western media coverage yet, despite 290K Chinese followers and provincial government intervention. The hospital closed its entire cardiac surgery department after the family went public.

I have a fact sheet, timeline, autopsy excerpts (translated), and high-res photos ready if you'd like to take a look. No pressure—just thought it might fit your beat on medical accountability.

[Your name]
[Fact sheet Google Doc link]

**How to Find Journalist Emails:**
- Hunter.io (free tier: 50 searches/month)
- Twitter bios (many journalists list emails publicly)
- Outlet contact pages (firstname.lastname@outlet.com format)

**Follow-Up Sequence:**
- Day 0: Send 10 emails (Monday AM)
- Day 3: First follow-up if no response (Wednesday)
- Day 7: Second follow-up + update (following Monday)
- Day 14: Final follow-up (Week 3)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Week 1: 0-2 responses (10-15% realistic)
- Week 2: 1-3 total responses (follow-ups increase response 30-50%)
- Week 4-8: 0-1 article published (regional/niche outlets)

**Success Criteria:**
- 1 journalist responds asking for materials = SUCCESS (validates pitch)
- 1 article published = MISSION SUCCESS (unblocks Wikipedia, creates credibility)
- 0 responses by Week 8 = Increase volume to 30+ journalists OR pivot to zh.wikipedia

---

### Reddit Seeding (2-3 Subreddits Week 1)

**Target Subreddits:**

**r/MedicalMalpractice (or similar):**
- Post title: "Baby died from unnecessary surgery in China. Autopsy contradicts hospital diagnosis. 290K following but zero Western media."
- Format: Detailed post (1,000-1,500 words) with timeline, evidence, sources
- Best time: Tuesday 9am EST

**r/China:**
- Post title: "Ningbo hospital closes cardiac surgery department after baby's death. Autopsy revealed surgery was unnecessary."
- Format: Focus on systemic angle, avoid anti-China political framing
- Best time: Wednesday 10am EST

**r/JusticeServed:**
- Post title: "Mother builds 290K followers, forces provincial government to intervene after hospital kills baby with fraudulent surgery"
- Format: David vs. Goliath success story (empowering)
- Best time: Thursday 7pm EST (evening traffic)

**Posting Strategy:**
- OP must respond to top 20 comments in first 2 hours (engagement = visibility)
- Provide sources in comments (build credibility)
- If post hits 1K+ upvotes: Journalists may contact you in DMs (monitor Reddit inbox)

**Expected Performance:**
- Conservative: 100-500 upvotes per post
- Target: 1K-3K upvotes (front page of subreddit)
- Optimistic: 10K+ upvotes (viral Reddit post reaches journalists organically)

---

### Organic Algorithm Optimization (Zero-Budget Growth)

**TikTok FYP Hacks:**
- Post at peak times: Tuesday 7pm EST, Sunday 6pm EST
- Respond to top 10 comments within 1 hour of posting (signals engagement)
- Use trending sounds (search TikTok Sound Library for "sad piano" with 10K+ uses)
- Encourage saves (not just likes)—"Bookmark this to share later" in caption

**Instagram Reels Algorithm:**
- Post consistently (3-5 Reels/week builds momentum, not 1 viral hit)
- Use all 30 hashtags (mix of large + niche)
- Respond to DMs within 24 hours (Instagram prioritizes responsive accounts)

**YouTube Shorts Algorithm:**
- Upload at least 3 Shorts in Week 1 (consistency matters more than single viral hit)
- End Shorts with question ("Part 2 in bio" = viewer visits channel)
- Use SEO-optimized titles (Baby Died from Unnecessary Surgery | The Luoxi Case)

**X/Twitter Algorithm:**
- Threads perform better than single tweets (15-tweet threads = more engagement)
- Tag 5-10 relevant accounts (journalists, organizations) to increase reach
- Post Tuesday-Thursday 9am EST (when journalists check Twitter)

**Reddit Algorithm:**
- Engage in comments (OP responses keep post visible longer)
- Avoid: Asking for upvotes (will get removed)
- Cross-post to related subreddits (but space out by 6-12 hours to avoid spam flags)

---

### Wikipedia Timeline (Submit Week 1-2, Live Week 3-5)

**NEW INTEL (Jan 14, 2026):** Wikipedia strategist discovered Mothership.sg (Singapore independent outlet) + 7 new English-language sources. READY TO SUBMIT NOW (do not wait for NYT/BBC/CNN).

**Submission Status:**
- **Article ready:** work/wikipedia/SUBMISSION-PACKAGE/article-final.txt (500 words, 18 citations)
- **Acceptance probability:** 60-70% (realistic given source quality)
- **Timeline:** Submit Week 1-2 → AfC review 2-4 weeks → Decision Week 4-6

**Why Submit NOW (Not Wait for Western Media):**
1. Mothership.sg is international independent source (Singapore, not China-controlled)
2. 81+ sources exceeds most Wikipedia articles (strong foundation)
3. Regional Asian coverage valid per WP:BIAS policy (don't need Western validation for Asian topics)
4. Can add NYT/BBC/CNN later if they cover story (article is living document)
5. Story is time-sensitive (maintain public interest NOW, don't let fade)

**Submission Process (Human Required):**
1. Create Wikipedia account (if don't have one)
2. Go to Wikipedia:Articles for creation (AfC)
3. Copy-paste from work/wikipedia/SUBMISSION-PACKAGE/article-final.txt
4. Submit for review
5. Wait 2-4 weeks for reviewer decision
6. If rejected: Use work/wikipedia/post-submission-plan.md response templates

**AfC Reviewer Defense (Pre-Prepared):**
- If challenged on sources: "81 sources including Mothership (Singapore independent), Global Times, 68 Chinese outlets. WP:BIAS supports regional coverage for Asian topics."
- If challenged on notability: "Provincial government intervention, entire hospital department closed, 290K+ social media following. Meets WP:GNG."
- If challenged on NPOV: "Article uses passive voice, attributes all claims, cites all facts. Zero advocacy language."

**Success Threshold:**
- Article accepted Week 4-6 = Permanent Wikipedia presence (SEO, credibility, permanence)
- Article rejected = Refine and resubmit OR wait for more Western sources (Month 2-3)

---

### Success Thresholds & Pivot Points

**Week 1 Success Criteria:**
- 50K-150K total views across 3 TikTok videos
- OR 1 journalist responds asking for materials
- OR Reddit post hits 1K+ upvotes

- Week 2: Scale TikTok (2-3 more videos using winning angle)
- Week 2: Expand to Instagram Reels + YouTube Shorts (repurpose TikTok content)
- Week 2: Follow up with interested journalists (send full press kit)

**If Week 1 Underperforms (<20K total TikTok views, 0 journalist responses, Reddit <500 upvotes):**
- Week 2: PIVOT—Test new formats (voiceover instead of text, 15s instead of 60s)
- Week 2: Increase journalist outreach volume (20-30 contacts instead of 10)
- Week 2: Focus on X/Twitter threads (maybe TikTok algorithm doesn't favor topic)

**If Week 4-8 Journalist Article Published:**
- Amplify article across all platforms (TikTok/IG/Twitter linking to article)
- Submit Wikipedia article with journalist source as Tier 1 citation
- Spend $50-100 promoting article on X/Twitter (boost credibility)

## SECTION 7: INTEGRATION WITH CHINESE & AUTHORITY FRAMEWORKS

### How Western Viral Content Supports Chinese Solidarity Messaging

**Strategic Principle:** Western viral content and Chinese solidarity messaging are NOT separate campaigns—they reinforce each other.

**Mechanic 1: Legitimacy Feedback Loop**
- Western media coverage → Chinese audiences see "international recognition" → Strengthens domestic resistance
- Chinese 290K Douyin followers → Western audiences see "grassroots movement already exists" → Validates story credibility

**Mechanic 2: Censorship Workaround**
- Content created for Western platforms (TikTok English, YouTube, Twitter) can be shared BACK to Chinese audiences via VPN/翻墙
- Western coverage harder for Chinese authorities to censor (can delete Weibo post, can't delete NYT article)

**Mechanic 3: Cultural Translation**
- Angle 3 (Grandmother photo) needs ZERO cultural translation—grief is universal
- Chinese audiences see same photo and feel same emotions, regardless of platform or language

**Cross-Platform Content Flow:**

```
TikTok English (Angle 3) → Goes viral in West → Chinese diaspora shares back to mainland via WeChat/Weibo → Chinese audiences watch "foreign" TikTok → Reinforces domestic mother's Douyin campaign → Provincial authorities see BOTH domestic AND international pressure → Higher likelihood of response
```

**Content Localization Strategy:**

**For Western audiences:**
- Emphasize documentary evidence (autopsy contradicts records)
- Frame as medical ethics violation (international standards)
- Use "Luoxi" name (humanize, not "Chinese baby")
- Avoid political framing (not "China bad" but "specific hospital failure")

**For Chinese audiences (parallel messaging):**
- Emphasize universal human values (family love, grief, justice)
- Frame as ordinary family vs. corrupt local officials (NOT "system failure")
- Use 洛熙 (Chinese characters) + grandmother photo (emotional anchor)
- Avoid sensitive political terms (维权, 人权, 集会, 抗议)

**Same Core Assets, Different Emphasis:**
- **Photo V005 (Grandmother):** Universal asset—use in BOTH Western and Chinese content
- **Autopsy evidence:** Western audiences = documentary proof; Chinese audiences = corruption exposure (local officials falsified records)
- **Mother's 290K followers:** Western audiences = David vs. Goliath; Chinese audiences = people power works (人民的力量)

---

### How Grassroots Pressure Creates Authority Off-Ramps

**Strategic Insight from Phase 2 Authority Framework:**
Chinese authorities don't respond well to external pressure demanding they change. BUT they respond VERY well to frameworks that allow them to look like heroes solving problems.

**Authority Off-Ramps Built into Viral Content:**

**Off-Ramp 1: Anti-Corruption Frame**
- **Western content angle:** "Hospital performed unnecessary surgery, lied about diagnosis"
- **Authority response it enables:** "This is exactly what Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign targets—local corruption betraying people's trust. We will act decisively."
- **Result:** Authorities look like reformers, not defendants

**Off-Ramp 2: Provincial vs. Local Dynamic**
- **Western content angle:** "Local officials tried to cover up, but provincial government intervened"
- **Authority response it enables:** "Local officials failed. Provincial leadership stepped in to protect people's interests. System works when higher authorities act."
- **Result:** Provincial officials look like heroes correcting local failures

**Off-Ramp 3: Systemic Reform Opportunity**
- **Western content angle:** "Entire cardiac department closed—proves systemic problem"
- **Authority response it enables:** "We are implementing 'Luoxi's Law' reforms: independent surgical review, tamper-proof records, criminal penalties for falsification."
- **Result:** Authorities look reform-minded, tragedy becomes catalyst for progress

**Off-Ramp 4: International Standards Leadership**
- **Western content angle:** "This violated international pediatric cardiology guidelines"
- **Authority response it enables:** "China's healthcare will meet/exceed international standards. We welcome international expert review."
- **Result:** Authorities look globally responsible, depoliticizes issue

**Off-Ramp 5: Grassroots Success Story**
- **Western content angle:** "Mother's 290K followers forced government response—grassroots activism works"
- **Authority response it enables:** "This shows our system is responsive to people's voices. Provincial intervention proves citizens can demand accountability."
- **Result:** Authorities look responsive, not oppressive

**Content Production Guideline:**
Every piece of Western viral content should include 1-2 sentences that provide authorities an off-ramp. Don't just rage—show path to resolution.

**Example (Angle 1 TikTok caption):**
❌ **Without off-ramp:** "Chinese hospital murdered baby. Government covering it up. Share before deleted."
✅ **With off-ramp:** "Hospital performed unnecessary surgery. Baby died. Provincial government intervened and closed entire department. But more accountability needed—criminal investigation, not just administrative discipline."

**Why This Works:**
- Acknowledges authorities DID respond (provincial intervention, department closure)
- BUT demands more (criminal investigation)
- Gives authorities pathway: "Okay, we close department (done). Now we do criminal investigation (next step)."

---

### Cross-Cultural Bridge Tactics

**Tactic 1: Diaspora as Bridge**
- Chinese diaspora (US, Canada, Europe, Australia) consume BOTH Western and Chinese media
- They can translate Western viral content back to Chinese social media
- They provide "third-party validation" (not Western propaganda, not just mainland voices)

**Tactic 2: Universal Visual Assets**
- Grandmother photo (V005) needs zero cultural context
- Before/after baby photos (V003) transcend language
- 2:05 AM timestamp is human detail everyone understands

**Tactic 3: Celebrity Validation Bridge**
- He Sui (international supermodel) = bridge between Chinese and Western audiences
- Han Hong (major Chinese singer) = domestic credibility that Western audiences can cite

**Tactic 4: Medical Ethics Depoliticization**
- Frame as professional standards violation (not geopolitical)
- "International pediatric cardiology guidelines" = neutral technical standards, not "Western values"
- Allows Chinese medical professionals to engage without political risk

**Tactic 5: Censorship as Unifying Theme**
- Western audiences: Outraged by censorship (freedom of speech values)
- Chinese audiences: Frustrated by censorship (want to know truth)
- Same enemy (censorship), different cultural reasons for opposing it

---

### Censorship Considerations for Content Creators

**For Western Platforms (TikTok English, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter):**
- **Low censorship risk:** Content in English on Western platforms unlikely to be censored by Chinese authorities
- **Exception:** If content goes MEGA viral (5M+ views), Chinese government may pressure platforms (unlikely for 500K-1M target)

**For Chinese Platforms (Douyin, Weibo, WeChat):**
- **High censorship risk:** Mother's 290K Douyin account vulnerable to deletion
- **Mitigation strategy:** Archive all her posts daily, have backup accounts ready
- **Content strategy:** Use safer vocabulary (see Chinese Framework Section 4: 审查规避策略)

**Safe Chinese Vocabulary:**
- ✅ Use: "医疗安全" (medical safety), "某医院" (certain hospital), "呼吁改革" (calling for reform)
- ❌ Avoid: "人权" (human rights), "维权" (rights defense), "抗议" (protest), "政府掩盖" (government cover-up)

**Content Production Guideline:**
- Produce content for Western platforms FIRST (no censorship constraints)
- If Chinese diaspora wants to translate/share back to mainland, THEY can adapt language for Chinese censorship environment
- Do NOT self-censor Western content to please Chinese authorities (defeats purpose)

**REALITY CHECK RECOMMENDATION:**

**MINIMUM VIABLE WEEK 1 (15-hour version):**
- Produce Video 1 only (8 hours including learning curve)
- Journalist outreach (5 hours: research + emails)
- Reddit posts (2 hours)
- **DEFER Video 2-3 to Week 2** (only if Video 1 succeeds)

**AGGRESSIVE WEEK 1 (25-hour version):**
- Produce Videos 1-2 (16 hours)
- Journalist outreach (5 hours)
- Reddit + Twitter (4 hours)
- **Skip Wikipedia submission to Week 2**

**CEO Decision Needed:** Which version? Recommend MINIMUM VIABLE (15 hours) to avoid burnout and test if Video 1 works before investing in Videos 2-3.

### Success Criteria (What "Good" Looks Like Week 1)

**Minimum Success (Continue to Week 2):**
- 20K-50K total views across TikTok videos
- 1 video with 10K+ views (proves one angle works)
- 100-300 followers gained
- 0-1 journalist email responses

**Target Success (Month 1 on track):**
- 60K-150K total views across TikTok videos
- 1-2 videos with 30K+ views each
- 500-1,500 followers gained
- 1-2 journalist email responses

**Breakthrough Success (Rare but possible):**
- 300K-700K total views (grandmother photo goes MEGA viral)
- Video 1 with 200K+ views, Videos 2-3 riding momentum
- 3K-8K followers gained
- 3-5 journalist organic inquiries (they found video, didn't wait for email)

**Decision Points:**

**If Week 1 = Minimum Success:**
- Week 2: Continue TikTok (1-2 more videos), follow up with journalist
- Month 2: Expand to Instagram/YouTube IF TikTok momentum sustains

**If Week 1 = Target Success:**
- Week 2: Scale TikTok (3-5 more videos using winning angle)
- Week 2: Expand to Instagram Reels + YouTube Shorts immediately
- Month 2: Invest $100-150 in TikTok Spark Ads for best video

**If Week 1 = Breakthrough Success:**
- Week 2: All-hands content production (10+ videos across platforms)
- Week 2: Journalist press kit distribution (send to 30+ journalists, not just 10)
- Month 2: Invest full $200 budget in promoted content + freelance help

**If Week 1 Underperforms (<20K total views):**
- Week 2: PIVOT—Test new formats, different angles, or shift to Reddit/Twitter priority
- Week 2: Increase journalist outreach to 20-30 contacts
- Month 2: Consider hiring freelance video editor ($50-150) to improve quality

### What To Do If Videos Underperform

**Symptom: Video 1 gets <5K views in 48 hours**

**Diagnosis Options:**

**Option 1: Hook Too Slow (Viewers scroll past in first 3 seconds)**
- Test: Remake Video 1 with FASTER hook (text appears at 0:00, not 0:03)
- Test: Try voiceover instead of text (some audiences prefer audio)

**Option 2: Algorithm Doesn't Favor Topic (TikTok may suppress "sad" content)**
- Pivot: Focus on X/Twitter threads + Reddit (text-based platforms)
- Pivot: Try YouTube (different algorithm, favors longer watch time)

**Option 3: Production Quality Too Low (blurry photo, text hard to read)**
- Fix: Hire Fiverr freelancer ($50-100) to remake Video 1 with better editing
- Fix: Use Canva Pro ($13/month, better templates than CapCut Free)

**Option 4: Angle Wrong for TikTok Audience**
- Test: Try Angle 1 (documentary evidence) instead of Angle 3 (emotion)
- Test: Try 15-second version (maybe 20 seconds too long for TikTok)

**Option 5: Timing Wrong (Posted at low-traffic time)**
- Repost: Same video, different time (Tuesday 7pm vs. Sunday 6pm)
- Repost: Test Saturday 10am (weekend browsing behavior different)

**CEO Guideline:** Don't give up after 1 video underperforms. TikTok algorithm is finicky—sometimes Video 1 flops but Video 2 (same content, minor tweaks) goes viral. Test at least 3 variations before pivoting platforms.

## CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR CONTENT AGENTS

**Q1: Are all 8 angles production-ready?**
- **Answer:** NO. Only Angles 1, 3, 7 are Week 1 ready (assets exist, translations sufficient).
- Angles 2, 5 require screenshot compilation (Week 2).
- Angles 4, 6, 8 require additional research/validation (defer to Month 2-3).

**Q2: Can 1 human produce content for all 4 platforms?**
- **Answer:** NO, not Week 1. Focus TikTok ONLY (3 videos = 20-27 hours).
- Instagram/YouTube Shorts Week 2-3 (repurpose TikTok content).
- X/Twitter Week 1 (but text-based, not video—lower production time).

**Q3: Is $200 budget realistic for any platform?**
- **Answer:** YES, IF spent strategically.
- TikTok Spark Ads: $100-150 can boost proven winner (50K organic → 150K-200K paid reach).
- DO NOT spend $200 on unproven content (wait for organic traction first).
- Alternative: $200 for freelance video editor to scale production (if human bottleneck identified).

**Q4: Should we prioritize journalist outreach OR TikTok production Week 1?**
- **Answer:** JOURNALIST OUTREACH has higher ROI (10-15% response rate, 1 article = 100K-500K reach).
- BUT TikTok provides faster feedback (24-48 hours vs. 4-8 weeks for article).
- **RECOMMENDATION:** Do BOTH (Video 1 + journalist emails = 13 hours total, realistic Week 1).

**Q5: What if zero journalists respond and TikTok underperforms?**
- **Answer:** Pivot to Reddit + Chinese platform amplification (work with mother's existing 290K Douyin base).
- Alternatively: Wait for legal case updates or anniversary (Nov 14, 2026) as news hook.
- Wikipedia can still be submitted with 81 sources (don't need Western media for zh.wikipedia).

## FINAL REALITY CHECK

**CEO Constraint Reminder:**
- 1 human worker
- $200 total budget
- 3-month window
- Zero professional video editing experience

**What This Brief Enables:**
- M4.1-M4.6 content agents can execute Week 1 with ONLY this brief (no need to read 15 Phase 2/3 files)
- Clear priority: Video 1 (Grandmother) + journalist outreach
- Realistic hour estimates (15-21 hours Week 1, not 40+)
- Pivot points defined (what to do if Week 1 underperforms)
- Budget discipline (spend $0 until proven organic traction)

**What This Brief Does NOT Provide:**
- Graphic design skills (human must learn CapCut or hire freelancer)
- Journalist relationships (100% cold outreach, 10-15% response rate realistic)
- Guaranteed viral success (grandmother photo is 10/10 asset, but algorithm unpredictable)

**Acceptance Probability:**
- 50K-150K reach in Month 1: 60-70% (realistic if execution solid)
- 1-2 journalist articles by Week 8: 40-50% (depends on outreach volume + story fit)
- Wikipedia article acceptance: 60-70% (source quality high, but AfC reviewers subjective)

**This is not a guarantee. This is the highest-probability path given constraints.**

**Execute.**
