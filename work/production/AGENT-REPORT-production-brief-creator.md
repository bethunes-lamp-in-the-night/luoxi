# Agent Report - Production Brief Creator (M4.0)

**Agent:** M4.0 - Production Brief Creator
**Date:** January 14, 2026
**Mission:** Consolidate Phase 2 (Narrative Architecture) + Phase 3 (Viral Mechanics & Growth) into single production-ready brief for content creation agents (M4.1-M4.6)
**Status:** COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully consolidated 15+ files (450KB+ total) from Phase 2 and Phase 3 into a single 67KB production brief that content agents can execute from without reading original research files. Brief addresses CEO's critical constraint (1 human, $200 budget) throughout and provides realistic Week 1 execution plan (15-21 hours).

**Key Deliverables:**
1. work/production/production-brief.md (67KB, 8 sections, production-ready)
2. work/production/angle-priority-matrix.md (8 angles ranked, Week 1-12 roadmap)
3. work/production/asset-inventory.md (Photos/docs mapped to angles, translation needs)
4. This agent report

**Consolidation Achievement:**
- Content agents need ONLY production-brief.md to execute Week 1 (80%+ of context included)
- No need to read: western-framework.md (78KB), platform-algorithms.md (114KB), growth-tactics.md (143KB), week-1-scripts.md (31KB), journalist-targets.md (27KB), wikipedia/strategy.md (71KB)
- Total reading reduction: 464KB → 67KB (86% reduction)

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Top 3 Angles for Week 1 (Not All 8)

**Rationale:**
- CEO constraint: 1 human, 15-21 hours/week max
- Phase 3 viral coefficients: Angle 3 (10/10), Angle 1 (8/10), Angle 7 (8/10)
- Production difficulty: Angle 3 easiest (5-7 hours), Angle 1 moderate (8-12 hours), Angle 7 moderate (6-8 hours)

**Recommendation in brief:**
- **MUST produce Week 1:** Angle 3 (Grandmother photo)
- **Produce IF Angle 3 succeeds (10K+ views):** Angle 1 (99.5% surgery)
- **Optional Week 1 OR defer Week 2:** Angle 7 (Remember Luoxi)
- **Defer to Week 2-3:** Angles 2, 5 (censorship, grassroots success)
- **Defer to Month 2-3:** Angles 4, 6, 8 (profit, medical community, hospital partnerships)

---

### Decision 2: TikTok Priority (Not Multi-Platform Week 1)

**Rationale:**
- Fastest viral feedback loop (24-48 hours vs. weeks for others)
- Lowest production barrier (CapCut mobile app, free)
- CEO originally requested "all platforms" (TikTok, YouTube Shorts, IG Reels, Twitter) but 1 human cannot produce for 4 platforms Week 1

**Recommendation in brief:**
- Week 1: TikTok ONLY (3 videos)
- Week 2: Expand to Instagram Reels + YouTube Shorts IF TikTok succeeds (repurpose content)
- Week 1: X/Twitter threads (text-based, lower production time) + Reddit posts
- Acknowledge constraint: "CEO wants all platforms BUT 1 human reality = focus best platform first, expand after proof of concept"

---

### Decision 3: Journalist Outreach = Highest ROI (Not Influencer/NGO Outreach)

**Rationale:**
- Phase 3 analysis: Journalist outreach 10-15% response rate (vs. 2-5% influencers)
- 1 article = 100K-500K reach + Wikipedia unblocked + permanent credibility
- Time investment: 5 hours Week 1 (research + 10 emails) vs. 10-15 hours for influencer research

**Recommendation in brief:**
- Week 1: 10 journalist contacts (3 medical reporters, 3 China correspondents, 2 regional Asia, 2 medical ethics)
- Week 1: Email templates provided (copy-paste with personalization)
- Expected: 1-2 responses by Week 2, 0-1 article by Week 4-8
- Influencer outreach deferred to Month 2 (only if journalist path fails)

---

### Decision 4: $0 Budget Week 1-4 (Save $200 for Proven Winners)

**Rationale:**
- CEO budget constraint: $200 TOTAL (not $200/month)
- Phase 3 minimum viable strategy: Organic-only Week 1-4, paid boost only for proven content
- Risk: Spending $200 on unproven content = wasted (can't afford failure)

**Recommendation in brief:**
- Week 1-4: $0 spent (all organic)
- Month 2: Spend $100-150 on TikTok Spark Ads ONLY if organic video hits 50K+ views (proof it works)
- Alternative Month 2 spend: $50-150 for freelance video editor IF human bottleneck identified
- Budget discipline: "Don't spend hoping content goes viral—wait for organic traction FIRST"

---

### Decision 5: Realistic Time Budget (15-21 Hours Week 1, Not 40+)

**Rationale:**
- Original week-1-scripts.md + journalist outreach + Reddit = 33-42 hours (NOT realistic for 1 human in 1 week)
- CEO needs ACHIEVABLE plan, not aspirational

**Recommendation in brief:**
- **MINIMUM VIABLE Week 1 (15 hours):** Video 1 only + journalist outreach
- **REALISTIC Week 1 (21 hours):** Videos 1-2 + journalist outreach + Reddit
- **AGGRESSIVE Week 1 (27 hours):** Videos 1-3 + journalist + Reddit + Twitter (possible but burnout risk)
- Defer Video 3 to Week 2 if time runs out (not critical for Week 1 momentum)

---

## Content Agents Should Focus On

### Week 1 Priority Actions (In Order)

**Action 1: Produce TikTok Video 1 (Grandmother Photo) — Tuesday 7pm post**
- Asset: Photo V005 (grandmother feeding empty clothes at 2:05 AM)
- Format: 20 seconds, SILENT, text overlays only
- Tool: CapCut mobile app (free)
- Time: 5-7 hours (includes learning curve)
- Success threshold: 10K+ views in 48 hours

**Action 2: Journalist Outreach (10 Contacts) — Tuesday AM**
- Research 10 journalists (Hunter.io, Twitter bios)
- Send personalized emails (template provided in Section 6)
- Track in Google Sheets (follow-up Day 7, Day 14)
- Time: 5 hours total
- Success threshold: 1-2 responses by Week 2

**Action 3: Reddit Seeding (2-3 Subreddits) — Tuesday-Thursday**
- Post to r/MedicalMalpractice, r/China, r/JusticeServed
- Detailed post (1,000-1,500 words with timeline/evidence)
- Engage in comments (first 2 hours critical)
- Time: 2 hours
- Success threshold: 1K+ upvotes on any post

**Action 4: Produce TikTok Video 2 (99.5% Surgery) — ONLY IF Video 1 Succeeds**
- IF Video 1 hits 10K+ views at 24 hours → produce Video 2
- Post Sunday 6pm EST (5 days after Video 1)
- Format: 60 seconds, pattern interrupts, optional music
- Time: 8-12 hours
- Success threshold: 15K+ views in 48 hours

**Action 5: Monitor & Iterate — Daily Week 1**
- Check Video 1 analytics at 1hr, 4hr, 12hr, 24hr
- Respond to top 10 comments (engagement boost)
- If underperforms (<5K views) → pivot strategy Week 2

**TOTAL TIME: 15-21 hours** (realistic for 1 human Week 1)

---

## What's Deferred to Later Phases

### Week 2-3 (IF Week 1 Succeeds)

**Content production:**
- Angle 7 (Remember Luoxi) if not done Week 1
- Angle 2 (Censorship) for follow-up content
- Angle 5 (Grassroots success) for momentum

**Platform expansion:**
- Instagram Reels (repurpose TikTok Videos 1-3)
- YouTube Shorts (repurpose TikTok Videos 1-3)
- X/Twitter threads (evidence-based, target journalists)

**Growth tactics:**
- Journalist follow-ups (Day 7, Day 14)
- Wikipedia article submission (if not done Week 1)
- TikTok Spark Ads ($100-150 IF video hits 50K+ organic)

---

### Month 2-3 (Sustainability Phase)

**Lower-priority angles:**
- Angle 4 (Profit motive) — only if pattern evidence emerges
- Angle 6 (Medical community) — target #MedTwitter, medical journals
- Angle 8 (Hospital partnerships) — institutional pressure campaign

**Alternative strategies if Week 1-4 underperforms:**
- Chinese platform amplification (work with mother's 290K Douyin base)
- Increase journalist outreach volume (30+ contacts instead of 10)
- Wait for legal case updates or anniversary (Nov 14, 2026) as news hook

---

## Blockers / Issues

### Issue 1: Translation Bottleneck

**Problem:**
- Autopsy report (Tab 3) requires translation of 3 key findings for Video 2 credibility
- Photo V002, V016, V018-V019 have Chinese text overlays needing English versions
- Medical records (150 pages) mostly untranslated

**Impact:**
- Video 2 (99.5% surgery) credibility reduced without autopsy excerpts
- Angle 2 (censorship) delayed until screenshots translated

**Mitigation:**
- Priority translation queue provided in asset-inventory.md
- HIGH PRIORITY (Week 1): Autopsy 3 findings (30 min using Google Translate + human review)
- MEDIUM PRIORITY (Week 2): Photos V002, V016, V018-V019 (30 min total)
- LOW PRIORITY (Week 3+): Medical records excerpts (4-6 hours) OR let journalists handle

**Recommendation:**
- Allocate 1 hour Week 1 for autopsy translation (blocks Video 2 production)
- Rest of translation can wait until Week 2

---

### Issue 2: Wikipedia Submission Timing

**Problem:**
- Wikipedia strategist (M3.3) recommends submitting NOW (Week 1-2) based on 81 sources ready
- But Wikipedia submission is 1-hour task that competes with video production
- If submission rejected, requires human to respond to reviewer objections

**Impact:**
- If Wikipedia submission deferred, may lose momentum (story time-sensitive)
- If Wikipedia submission prioritized, Video 2-3 production delayed

**Mitigation:**
- Wikipedia submission is LOW time cost (1 hour), HIGH strategic value (permanence, credibility)
- Can be done in parallel with video production (different days)

**Recommendation:**
- Submit Wikipedia Week 1 (Wednesday or Thursday, not Tuesday—avoid conflict with Video 1 post day)
- Decision timeline: 2-4 weeks (passive waiting, no ongoing time cost)
- If rejected: Use pre-prepared defense templates from wikipedia/post-submission-plan.md

---

### Issue 3: Realistic Expectations for Week 1

**Problem:**
- CEO may expect immediate viral success (500K+ views Week 1)
- Reality: 50K-150K views Week 1 is OPTIMISTIC success
- Reality: 0-1 journalist responses Week 1 is realistic (articles take 4-8 weeks to publish)

**Impact:**
- If CEO judges Week 1 as "failure" due to unrealistic expectations, may abandon campaign prematurely

**Mitigation:**
- Production brief Section 1 clearly defines success thresholds:
  - **Minimum success:** 20K-50K total views (continue to Week 2)
  - **Target success:** 60K-150K total views (Month 1 on track)
  - **Breakthrough success:** 300K-700K total views (rare but possible)

**Recommendation:**
- Set CEO expectations: Week 1 is TEST phase, not VIRAL phase
- Success = proving one angle works (10K+ on single video) + 1-2 journalist responses
- Viral growth is Week 2-4 outcome if Week 1 test succeeds

---

## Critical Questions & Answers

### Q1: Are all 8 angles production-ready?

**Answer:** NO. Only Angles 1, 3, 7 are Week 1 ready.
- Angle 3 (Grandmother): 100% ready (single photo, no dependencies)
- Angle 1 (Surgery): 95% ready (need 30 min autopsy translation)
- Angle 7 (Memorial): 100% ready (baby photos, TikTok music library)
- Angles 2, 5: Need screenshot compilation (Week 2)
- Angles 4, 6, 8: Need additional research (Month 2-3)

---

### Q2: Can 1 human produce content for all 4 platforms Week 1?

**Answer:** NO. Focus TikTok ONLY Week 1 (3 videos = 20-27 hours).
- Instagram Reels Week 2 (repurpose TikTok content, <1 hour per video)
- YouTube Shorts Week 2 (same repurposing strategy)
- X/Twitter Week 1 (but text-based threads, not video—2-3 hours)

**Rationale:**
- Multi-platform production Week 1 = 40+ hours (not realistic)
- TikTok provides fastest feedback loop (test if content works in 24-48 hours)
- After proof of concept, repurposing is fast (Week 2 expansion)

---

### Q3: Is $200 budget realistic for any platform?

**Answer:** YES, IF spent strategically on proven winners only.
- TikTok Spark Ads: $100-150 boosts 50K organic → 150K-200K paid reach
- Expected ROI: $100 = 30K-50K additional reach (3-5x multiplier)
- **DO NOT spend** $200 on unproven content (zero organic traction = paid ads fail too)

**Alternative $200 uses:**
- Hire Fiverr video editor ($50-150) to scale production if human bottleneck
- Paid PR distribution (PRWeb $100-200) if 0 journalist responses by Week 8

---

### Q4: Should we prioritize journalist outreach OR TikTok production Week 1?

**Answer:** DO BOTH (13 hours combined = realistic).
- Video 1 (Grandmother): 8 hours (includes learning curve)
- Journalist outreach: 5 hours (research + 10 emails)
- **Why both:** Journalist = highest ROI (credibility, Wikipedia unblock) but 4-8 week payoff; TikTok = fast feedback (24-48 hours) but requires journalist articles for long-term credibility

**Time allocation:**
- Monday: Learn CapCut (2 hours) + journalist research (3 hours)
- Tuesday AM: Send journalist emails (2 hours)
- Tuesday PM: Produce Video 1 (6 hours)
- Tuesday 7pm: Post Video 1, monitor, respond to comments (2 hours)

---

### Q5: What if zero journalists respond AND TikTok underperforms?

**Answer:** Pivot to Reddit + Chinese platform amplification.
- Reddit has higher organic reach potential (1K+ upvotes = journalists find YOU)
- Mother's 290K Douyin base = existing momentum (work with her to cross-promote)
- Wikipedia can still submit with 81 sources (don't need Western media for zh.wikipedia Chinese version)
- Alternative: Wait for legal case updates (ongoing) or anniversary (Nov 14, 2026) as news hook

**Don't give up:** Phase 3 minimum viable strategy designed for $0 budget, zero journalist coverage scenario. Can still achieve 500K+ reach organically over 3 months.

## Next Steps (For CEO)

**Immediate (This Week):**
1. Review production-brief.md (67KB, 8 sections)
2. Decide: MINIMUM VIABLE Week 1 (15 hours) OR REALISTIC Week 1 (21 hours)?
3. Spawn content agents M4.1-M4.6 OR human executes directly using brief

**Week 1 Execution:**
1. Produce Video 1 (Grandmother photo) — Tuesday 7pm post
2. Send 10 journalist emails — Tuesday AM
3. Post to 2-3 Reddit subreddits — Tuesday-Thursday
4. Monitor Video 1 performance — Decide by Wednesday if produce Video 2

**Week 2 Decision Point:**
1. If Video 1 succeeds (10K+ views) → Produce Videos 2-3, expand to Instagram/YouTube
2. If Video 1 underperforms (<5K views) → PIVOT (test new formats OR focus journalist/Reddit)
3. Follow up with journalists (Day 7) — Send 2nd email to non-responders

---

## Files Created

1. **work/production/production-brief.md (67KB)**
   - 8 sections: Mission, 8 Angles, Evidence, Platforms, Production, Growth, Integration, Week 1 Checklist
   - Target audience: Content agents M4.1-M4.6 (can execute without reading Phase 2/3 files)
   - Tone: Production-ready (less analysis, more "here's what to make")

2. **work/production/angle-priority-matrix.md (21KB)**
   - 8 angles ranked by: Viral potential + Production difficulty + Asset readiness + Platform fit + Emotional impact
   - Week 1-12 production roadmap
   - Platform-specific recommendations (TikTok vs. Twitter vs. YouTube)

3. **work/production/asset-inventory.md (31KB)**
   - 10 photo assets ranked by viral potential + production readiness
   - Document assets (autopsy, medical records) with translation needs
   - Asset-to-angle mapping (which photos for which videos)

## Consolidation Quality Check

**Test: Can M4.1-M4.6 execute with ONLY production-brief.md?**

**Answer: YES (80%+ context included).**
- Video production: Exact scripts, timing, text overlays provided (from week-1-scripts.md)
- Journalist outreach: 10 targets, email templates, follow-up sequence provided (from journalist-targets.md)
- Platform mechanics: TikTok FYP triggers, posting times, success thresholds provided (from platform-algorithms.md)
- Asset guidance: Photos V005, V003, V001 prioritized with usage instructions (from media-index-brief.md)

**What's NOT in production brief (agents need to reference originals):**
- Full 60-page autopsy report (agents use translated excerpts only)
- Full 150-page medical records (agents use selective excerpts only)
- Comprehensive platform reference (brief has MINIMUM VIABLE, algorithms.md has full 114KB)

**Verdict: Production brief achieves 80%+ consolidation goal.** Agents can execute Week 1 without reading Phase 2/3 files. Original files remain as reference for deep dives (Month 2+).

---

## Constraint Integration Check

**Test: Does brief acknowledge 1 human + $200 budget throughout?**

**Answer: YES.**
- Section 1: Mission & Constraints (explicit budget/time reality check)
- Section 5: Time budget broken down (15-21 hours Week 1, not 40+)
- Section 5: "OPTION A: Focus Video 1 only" acknowledges realistic limits
- Section 6: "$0 Week 1-4" budget discipline emphasized
- Section 8: "CEO Decision Needed: Which version?" explicitly asks for constraint prioritization

**Constraint violations avoided:**
- No assumption of professional video editor (all free tools)
- No assumption of multi-platform Week 1 (TikTok focus)
- No assumption of unlimited time (realistic hour estimates)
- No assumption of budget for unproven content ($200 saved for winners only)

**Verdict: Brief respects CEO constraints throughout. Not aspirational—achievable.**

---

## Conclusion

Production brief consolidates 464KB of Phase 2/3 research into 67KB production-ready document. Content agents M4.1-M4.6 can execute Week 1 with:
- Clear priorities (Angle 3 first, Angle 1 if succeeds, Angle 7 optional)
- Realistic time budgets (15-21 hours, not 40+)
- Exact scripts (copy-paste into CapCut)
- Success thresholds (10K+ views = continue, <5K = pivot)
- Constraint discipline (1 human, $200 saved for proven winners)

**Ready for CEO review and content agent execution.**

**Status: COMPLETE**
