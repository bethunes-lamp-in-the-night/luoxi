## ANGLE 3: "Grandmother Feeding Empty Clothes at 2 AM"

### Scores

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Viral Potential | 10/10 | Phase 3 ranked 10/10—universal devastation |
| Production Difficulty | 10/10 | Single photo, text overlays only, 5-7 hours |
| Asset Readiness | 10/10 | Photo V005 ready, no translation needed |
| Platform Fit | 10/10 | Silent photo = ideal for TikTok/IG Reels |
| Emotional Impact | 10/10 | Transcends language, age, culture—pure grief |
| **COMPOSITE SCORE** | **10.0/10** | **HIGHEST PRIORITY** |

### Week 1 Production Status: ✅ PRODUCE FIRST (Tuesday Week 1)

**Why Week 1:**
- Shortest production time (5-7 hours including CapCut learning curve)
- Highest viral probability (10/10 asset, universal emotion)
- Zero dependencies (single photo, no complex editing)
- Tests if TikTok algorithm favors emotional content

**Platforms:**
- PRIMARY: TikTok (15-20 sec silent video)
- SECONDARY: Instagram Reels (same video)
- TERTIARY: X/Twitter (single image post)

**Success threshold:** 10K+ views in 48 hours = produce Angle 1 next

---

## ANGLE 1: "The 99.5% Surgery That Killed a Baby"

### Scores

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Viral Potential | 8/10 | Phase 3 ranked 8/10—documentary proof angle |
| Production Difficulty | 6/10 | 60-sec video, 16 text overlays, pattern interrupts (8-12 hours) |
| Asset Readiness | 8/10 | Photos ready (V003, V005), autopsy needs translation highlights |
| Platform Fit | 9/10 | Perfect for TikTok 60-sec timeline format |
| Emotional Impact | 9/10 | Trust betrayed + documentary evidence = powerful |
| **COMPOSITE SCORE** | **8.0/10** | **SECOND PRIORITY** |

### Week 1 Production Status: ✅ PRODUCE SECOND (IF Angle 3 succeeds)

**Why Week 1 (conditional):**
- If Angle 3 hits 10K+ views → audience wants MORE (context/evidence)
- Provides documentary credibility (not just emotion)
- Pattern interrupt mechanics tested in Phase 3 (15s/30s checkpoints)

**Platforms:**
- PRIMARY: TikTok (60-sec documentary format)
- SECONDARY: YouTube (expand to 10-15 min deep dive Week 2)
- TERTIARY: X/Twitter (15-tweet thread version)

**Success threshold:** 15K+ views in 48 hours = evidence angle resonates

---

## ANGLE 7: "Remember Her Name: Luoxi"

### Scores

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Viral Potential | 8/10 | Phase 3 ranked 8/10—memorial movements work |
| Production Difficulty | 8/10 | 30-sec slideshow, simple music, 6-8 hours |
| Asset Readiness | 9/10 | Baby photos ready (V024-V025), gentle music from TikTok library |
| Platform Fit | 8/10 | Works on TikTok/IG, better on Instagram (aesthetic) |
| Emotional Impact | 9/10 | Humanizing, defeats erasure, becomes campaign identity |
| **COMPOSITE SCORE** | **8.4/10** | **THIRD PRIORITY** |

### Week 1 Production Status: ✅ PRODUCE THIRD (Thursday Week 1 OR defer to Week 2)

**Why Week 1 (flexible):**
- Memorial angle works best AFTER audience knows story (Angles 1-2 provide context)
- Establishes #RememberLuoxi as campaign hashtag consolidation
- Can defer to Week 2 if time runs out (not critical for Week 1 momentum)

**Platforms:**
- PRIMARY: Instagram (memorial aesthetic, carousel option)
- SECONDARY: TikTok (30-sec photo slideshow)
- TERTIARY: Dedicated memorial website (RememberLuoxi.org—Month 2)

**Success threshold:** 8K+ views + high comment quality ("Remember Luoxi" text) = campaign identity established

---

## ANGLE 2: "What They Don't Want You To See"

### Scores

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Viral Potential | 7/10 | Phase 3 ranked 7/10—forbidden knowledge hook |
| Production Difficulty | 5/10 | Screenshot compilation, archive documentation (10-12 hours) |
| Asset Readiness | 6/10 | Hospital deletion documented, need CDT archives + screenshot layout |
| Platform Fit | 6/10 | Better for X/Twitter threads than TikTok (text-heavy) |
| Emotional Impact | 7/10 | Outrage (censorship) but less visceral than Angles 1/3 |
| **COMPOSITE SCORE** | **6.2/10** | **FOURTH PRIORITY** |

### Week 2-3 Production Status: ⏸ DEFER (Use as follow-up AFTER Angles 1/3 establish credibility)

**Why defer to Week 2:**
- Censorship angle works better AFTER people care about story (need emotional hook first)
- Screenshot compilation time-intensive (10-12 hours)
- X/Twitter threads have slower viral velocity than TikTok

**Platforms:**
- PRIMARY: X/Twitter (thread with archived screenshots)
- SECONDARY: TikTok/IG ("Things they deleted" series)
- TERTIARY: Reddit (r/China with deletion evidence)

**Production trigger:** If Angles 1/3 reach 50K+ combined views → produce Angle 2 Week 2

---

## ANGLE 5: "290,000 Parents vs. The System—And They're Winning"

### Scores

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Viral Potential | 7/10 | Phase 3 ranked 7/10—empowering grassroots story |
| Production Difficulty | 6/10 | Follower count graphics, timeline visualization (10-14 hours) |
| Asset Readiness | 7/10 | Mother's follower count documented, protest photos (V018-V019) |
| Platform Fit | 8/10 | TikTok meta-story (TikTok activism on TikTok) |
| Emotional Impact | 8/10 | Empowering (activism works) but requires more context |
| **COMPOSITE SCORE** | **7.2/10** | **FIFTH PRIORITY** |

### Week 2-3 Production Status: ⏸ DEFER (Use to SUSTAIN campaign after initial breakthrough)

**Why defer to Week 2:**
- Grassroots success angle works best once Western audience sees results of their sharing
- Requires graphics (follower count progression timeline)
- Best used as Week 2-3 content to sustain momentum (not Week 1 breakthrough)

**Platforms:**
- PRIMARY: TikTok (meta-activism story)
- SECONDARY: LinkedIn (case study for organizers/activists)
- TERTIARY: Podcasts (activism tactics discussion)

**Production trigger:** If journalist responds OR Wikipedia submitted → "Your voice mattered, here's proof" narrative ready

---

## ANGLE 4: "The Hospital That Kills Babies for Profit"

### Scores

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Viral Potential | 6/10 | Phase 3 ranked 6/10—profit motive speculative |
| Production Difficulty | 4/10 | Requires financial research, pattern investigation (20+ hours) |
| Asset Readiness | 3/10 | Profit motive NOT documented—needs investigative work |
| Platform Fit | 5/10 | Risk of conspiracy-theory framing on TikTok |
| Emotional Impact | 7/10 | Rage-inducing but speculative without evidence |
| **COMPOSITE SCORE** | **5.0/10** | **SIXTH PRIORITY** |

### Month 2-3 Production Status: ⏸ DEFER (Only if pattern evidence emerges)

**Why defer to Month 2-3:**
- Profit motive is speculative (not proven in autopsy/medical records)
- Requires pattern evidence (5+ other deaths at hospital—currently unverified)
- Risk of alienating credible audience if claims unsupported

**Platforms:**
- PRIMARY: Long-form YouTube documentary (needs 20-30 min to make case)
- SECONDARY: Investigative journalism partnership (if journalist covers story)

**Production trigger:** IF legal case reveals financial incentives OR other families come forward with similar cases

## ANGLE 6: "The International Medical Community Must Speak"

### Scores

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Viral Potential | 5/10 | Phase 3 ranked 5/10—too clinical for general audience |
| Production Difficulty | 5/10 | Requires expert interviews, medical guideline citations (15-20 hours) |
| Asset Readiness | 4/10 | Need to source international ASD guidelines, expert quotes |
| Platform Fit | 3/10 | Too technical for TikTok/IG (better for #MedTwitter, journals) |
| Emotional Impact | 4/10 | Professional accountability angle—less visceral |
| **COMPOSITE SCORE** | **4.2/10** | **SEVENTH PRIORITY** |

### Month 2-3 Production Status: ⏸ DEFER (Slower burn, targets medical professionals)

**Why defer to Month 2-3:**
- Too clinical for Week 1 general audience (need emotional hook first)
- Requires expert outreach (medical professionals, journal submissions)
- Slower payoff timeline (months not weeks)

**Platforms:**
- PRIMARY: Medical ethics journals (case report submission)
- SECONDARY: #MedTwitter threads (target doctors/nurses)
- TERTIARY: Medical podcasts (The Lancet Voice, JAMA podcasts)

**Production trigger:** After 1-2 journalist articles establish credibility → pitch medical journals

---

## ANGLE 8: "Could This Happen Where You Live?"

### Scores

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Viral Potential | 6/10 | Phase 3 ranked 6/10—localization angle |
| Production Difficulty | 3/10 | Requires research on hospital partnerships (25+ hours) |
| Asset Readiness | 2/10 | Need to identify US/Europe hospitals partnered with Ningbo hospital |
| Platform Fit | 5/10 | Narrow audience (specific medical school communities) |
| Emotional Impact | 6/10 | Localization increases relevance but requires research |
| **COMPOSITE SCORE** | **4.4/10** | **EIGHTH PRIORITY** |

### Month 3+ Production Status: ⏸ DEFER (Institutional pressure campaign)

**Why defer to Month 3:**
- Requires investigative research (hospital partnerships, medical school exchanges)
- Narrow audience targeting (US/Europe medical communities)
- Only valuable AFTER broader awareness established

**Platforms:**
- PRIMARY: Targeted campaigns to specific universities/hospitals
- SECONDARY: Medical student groups, resident associations
- TERTIARY: Hospital accreditation boards (JCAHO, etc.)

**Production trigger:** After Wikipedia article live + journalist articles published → institutional credibility to approach medical schools

2. Angle 1 (99.5% surgery) — 9/10 platform fit
3. Angle 7 (Remember Luoxi) — 8/10 platform fit
4. Angle 5 (Grassroots success) — 8/10 platform fit

**AVOID:**
- Angle 6 (Too clinical for TikTok)

---

### X/Twitter (SECONDARY Week 1)

**AVOID:**
- Angle 3 (Single image works, but TikTok better for video version)

---

### YouTube (WEEK 2-3 expansion)

**BEST ANGLES:**
1. Angle 1 (99.5% surgery) — Expand to 10-15 min documentary
2. Angle 4 (Profit motive) — IF evidence exists, needs long-form investigation
3. Angle 6 (Medical community) — Educational/explainer format

**AVOID:**
- Angle 3 (Grandmother photo better as short-form, not long video)

---

### Reddit (WEEK 1 seeding)

**BEST ANGLES:**

2. Angle 5 (Grassroots) — r/JusticeServed loves David vs. Goliath
3. Angle 2 (Censorship) — r/China audience interested in deletion evidence

**AVOID:**
- Angle 3 (Single image needs more context for Reddit text-focused format)

---
