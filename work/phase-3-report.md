# Phase 3 Quality Assurance Report to CEO

**From:** Phase 3 Lieutenant - Quality Assurance Officer
**Date:** January 14, 2026
**Re:** Phase 3 Deliverables Assessment & Phase 4 Readiness

---

## Overall Assessment: **CONDITIONAL PASS**

Phase 3 has delivered exceptional strategic frameworks with world-class viral mechanics research and sophisticated growth tactics. However, a critical strategic constraint (CEO lacks influencer contacts) was identified mid-execution, forcing a major V2 pivot on growth strategy. Wikipedia work is comprehensive but blocked on international media coverage.

**Bottom Line:** Phase 3 intelligence is production-ready for Phase 4 content creators. Strategic frameworks are sound. Execution quality will determine success.

---

## Executive Summary

### Strengths
- M3.1 (Viral Mechanics): Exceptional platform algorithm intelligence with actionable tactics
- M3.2 (Growth Hacking): V2 pivot demonstrates adaptive problem-solving under constraints
- M3.3 (Wikipedia): Strategic realism with v2 "start small" approach minimizing rejection risk
- All agents delivered comprehensive, evidence-based frameworks ready for execution
- Integration with Phase 2 narrative angles is strong (grandmother photo prioritized across all deliverables)

### Critical Blockers
- **M3.2 Constraint:** CEO has zero influencer contacts → requires 10x higher volume cold outreach
- **M3.3 Constraint:** Needs 2-3 major Western media outlets (NYT, BBC, CNN) before Wikipedia submission
- **Integration Gap:** Wikipedia timeline (2-4 weeks for media) conflicts with viral launch timing (Week 1)

### Phase 4 Readiness
**YES - with sequencing adjustments:** Content production can begin immediately using M3.1 viral mechanics + M3.2 organic strategies. Wikipedia submission follows Western media pickup (Week 3-4).

## Individual Agent Grades

### M3.1 - Viral Mechanics Researcher: **A**

**Deliverable:** work/viral-mechanics/platform-algorithms.md (2,267 lines, ~94KB)

**Agent Report:** work/viral-mechanics/AGENT-REPORT-viral-mechanics-researcher.md

**Strengths:**
1. **Actionable Platform Intelligence:**
   - TikTok/Instagram: FYP algorithm triggers (completion rate 40%, engagement velocity 30%)
   - First 3 seconds = 80% of viral success (specific hook formulas provided)
   - Pattern interrupt timing at 3s, 15s, 30s marks (backed by 2026 algorithm research)
   - 15 proven hook formulas with Luoxi applications for each angle

2. **YouTube Optimization:**
   - Shorts vs. long-form mechanics differentiated (swipe velocity vs. completion rate)
   - Thumbnail psychology (high contrast, emotional faces, 3-5 word text maximum)
   - Title formulas with 50-70 character optimization
   - Conversion tactics (Shorts→Long-form: cliffhangers, end screens, 5-10% expected conversion)

3. **Twitter/X Thread Strategies:**
   - Optimal thread length: 15-20 tweets for investigative content
   - Hook tweet formulas (shocking statement, forbidden knowledge, pattern interrupt)
   - Timing for journalist pickup: 9-11am EST Monday-Friday
   - Quote tweet bait and reply bait tactics

4. **Angle-Specific Optimization:**
   - Viral coefficient predictions (Angle 3 grandmother = 10/10, Angle 1 surgery = 8/10)
   - Platform recommendations per angle (TikTok vs YouTube vs Twitter)
   - Deployment sequence: Angle 3 → Angle 1 → Angle 7 (Tuesday 7pm EST launch optimal)
   - Conservative reach: 10-20M impressions in 4 weeks; optimistic: 30-50M with influencer pickups

**Gaps:**
- Video transcription blocker remains (21 videos unanalyzed from Phase 1) - flagged but not critical
- Some viral coefficient predictions lack hard data (based on comparative case analysis vs. A/B testing)
- Reddit strategy under-developed compared to other platforms
- No Facebook/LinkedIn specific guidance (though lower priority for viral content)

**Integration with Phase 2:**
- ✅ Perfect alignment with Western Framework angles (Angle 3 grandmother prioritized in all platforms)
- ✅ Emotional arc timing (Trust→Betrayal→Rage→Hope) matches narrative framework structure
- ✅ Platform-specific hook formulas directly map to 8 Western angles

**Production Readiness:**
- **Week 1 Ready:** Angle 3, Angle 1, Angle 7 have complete viral mechanics blueprints
- **Immediate Use:** 15 hook formulas, pattern interrupt timings, posting schedules all actionable
- **A/B Testing Framework:** Provided for Week 1 optimization (hook variations, thumbnail tests)

**Grade Rationale:** World-class platform intelligence with zero fluff. Every section has immediate tactical value. Only minor gaps (video analysis, some data validation) prevent A+. This is exactly what Phase 4 content producers need.

### M3.2 - Growth Hacking Strategist: **B+**

**Deliverable:** work/viral-mechanics/growth-tactics.md (3,136 lines, ~86KB V2 updated)

**Agent Report:** work/viral-mechanics/AGENT-REPORT-growth-hacking-strategist.md

**Strengths:**
1. **V2 Strategic Pivot (Major Achievement):**
   - Identified critical CEO constraint: "I don't know any influencers of any size"
   - Complete strategy revision: warm outreach (30-50% response) → cold outreach (2-5% response)
   - Volume-based approach: 10x higher contact targets (200-300 influencers vs. 50)
   - Realistic success metrics adjusted: Week 1: 0-1 partnerships (not 2-3); Week 4: 3-5 (not 10+)

2. **Alternative Growth Mechanisms (Zero Influencer Dependency):**
   - Organic algorithm optimization (TikTok FYP, Instagram Explore, Reddit front page)
   - Paid amplification tactics ($100-500 = 100K+ reach without relationships)
   - Journalist outreach prioritized (10-15% cold response vs. 2-5% for influencers)
   - Community-first approach (500 engaged members = more reach than 1 macro-influencer)
   - NGO/activist outreach (15-25% response rate, mission-aligned)

3. **High-ROI Target Prioritization:**
   - Tier 1: Journalists (10-15% response) - Contact 50 Week 1, expect 5-8 responses, 2-3 articles
   - Tier 2: Activists/NGOs (15-25% response) - Contact 30, expect 5-8 responses
   - Tier 3: Medical professionals (8-12% response) - Depoliticized credibility
   - Tier 4: Influencers (2-5% response) - DEPRIORITIZED but still contacted (200-300 volume)
   - Tier 5: Reddit (not outreach, but if 1K+ upvotes → organic journalist inquiries)

4. **Value-First Outreach Strategy:**
   - Content Kit approach (fact sheet, TikTok script, Instagram carousel, Twitter thread pre-made)
   - "Materials ready, want them?" vs. "Will you cover this?" (5-10% response vs. 2-5%)
   - Platform-specific cold outreach tactics (Instagram DM timing, Twitter public-first, Reddit seeding)
   - Follow-up sequences (Day 3, Day 7, Day 14) increase response 30-50%

**Gaps:**
1. **Over-Comprehensive:** 86KB V2 document is tactically dense but overwhelming for executor
   - Week 1 action list has 20+ items across 5 tiers (execution complexity high)
   - Would benefit from single-page "Quick Start Guide" distilling top 10 Week 1 actions

2. **Cold Outreach Templates Need Testing:**
   - DM templates provided but not A/B tested (response rate assumptions untested)
   - Email subject lines crucial for journalists (current templates good but could be sharper)
   - No feedback loop mechanism (how to improve templates based on Week 1 results)

3. **Budget Allocation Not Specified:**
   - Paid amplification section excellent ($100-500 tactics) but no recommended budget split
   - TikTok Spark Ads vs. Instagram Ads vs. Google Ads - which gets what percentage?
   - No guidance on "if you only have $100, prioritize X; if $500, add Y"

4. **Community Building Under-Detailed:**
   - Discord/Facebook Group strategy mentioned but minimal operational guidance
   - Week 1-4 growth targets (10→50→200→500 members) but no acquisition tactics specified
   - Missing: how to activate community for weekly sharing campaigns

**Integration with Phase 2:**
- ✅ Strong alignment: V2 journalist-first approach matches Authority Framework (quiet official outreach before public pressure)
- ✅ Grassroots tactics complement Chinese Framework (community amplification vs. top-down)
- ⚠️ Tension with Western Framework Angle 2 (censorship): V2 suggests journalists first, but Angle 2 is "what they don't want you to know" (public pressure). Sequencing matters.

**Integration with M3.1:**
- ✅ Excellent: Growth tactics reference viral mechanics hooks, posting times, platform algorithms
- ✅ Reddit strategy complements M3.1's Twitter thread focus
- ⚠️ Paid amplification section needs M3.1 viral coefficient predictions to prioritize ad spend (e.g., boost Angle 3 not Angle 6)

**V2 vs. V1 Assessment:**
- **V2 is fundamentally better strategy** given CEO constraint
- V1 would have failed (2-5% cold response with 50 contacts = 1-2 responses max)
- V2 realistic expectations prevent discouragement + provides multiple success paths
- V2 addition of 70+ pages is tactical depth (good) but execution complexity (risk)

**Production Readiness:**
- **Week 1 Ready:** Journalist outreach templates, Reddit post format, organic algorithm tactics all actionable
- **Needs Refinement:** Prioritization matrix (which of 20+ Week 1 tasks are must-do vs. nice-to-have?)
- **Blocker Mitigation:** If influencers don't respond, V2 provides 4 alternative paths (organic, paid, journalists, community)

**Grade Rationale:** V2 pivot demonstrates world-class strategic problem-solving. The constraint identification and complete strategy revision is A-level work. Deductions for execution complexity (too many tactics, not enough prioritization) and untested templates. Once streamlined, this is A-grade intelligence.

### M3.3 - Wikipedia Strategist: **A-**

**Deliverable:** work/wikipedia/strategy.md (45KB)

**Deliverable:** work/wikipedia/article-draft.md (v1, 26KB, 3,500 words)

**Deliverable:** work/wikipedia/article-draft-v2.md (v2, ~415 words, proper Wikipedia markup)

**Agent Report:** work/wikipedia/AGENT-REPORT-wikipedia-v2.md

**Strengths:**
1. **Strategic Realism with V2 Pivot:**
   - V1 draft (3,500 words) identified as high rejection risk → V2 (415 words, 88% reduction)
   - "Start small" philosophy: get article accepted FIRST, expand gradually SECOND
   - V2 acceptance probability: 65-75% vs. V1: 30-40% (2x improvement)
   - Phased expansion roadmap: Week 3-6 (+300 words), Month 2-3 (+800 words), final target 1,500-2,000 words

2. **Notability Assessment (Rigorous):**
   - General Notability Guideline (GNG) analysis: CONDITIONAL PASS
   - Meets criteria: Significant domestic coverage (68+ Chinese sources), independent sources, public impact
   - Critical gap: Needs 2-3 major Western outlets (NYT, BBC, CNN, Reuters, AP)
   - Comparative precedent analysis: Similar to Charlie Gard, Alfie Evans, Peng Shuai (all successful Wikipedia articles)

3. **Source Quality Control:**
   - V2 uses ONLY Tier 1 sources (11 citations: The Paper, Sina, China Daily, Sixth Tone)
   - Eliminated ALL Tier 2/3 sources (Zhihu, Vision Times, social media direct citations)
   - Citation density: 1 citation per 38 words (exceptionally high, demonstrates rigorous sourcing)
   - Proper Wikipedia markup: {{cite news}} templates, <ref> tags, infobox complete

4. **NPOV Ultra-Conservative Compliance:**
   - Attribution throughout: "According to reports citing the autopsy..."
   - Passive voice: "Discrepancies were found" vs. "Hospital lied about diagnosis"
   - Zero editorializing: Omitted graphic details (unsutured wounds), profit motive speculation, pattern claims
   - V2 minimizes NPOV surface area (75-80% lower dispute risk vs. V1)

5. **Comprehensive Strategy Document:**
   - Submission timeline with prerequisites clearly mapped (Week 4 peer review, Week 5-6 AfC submission)
   - Risk assessment (deletion challenges, NPOV disputes, political editing) with mitigation tactics
   - AfC defense talking points for all predictable objections ("not notable," "too many Chinese sources," "current event")
   - Monitoring plan (daily first week, weekly first month, monthly long-term)

**Gaps:**
1. **International Media Dependency (Critical Blocker):**
   - V2 article ready BUT cannot submit without 2-3 Western outlets
   - Timeline: 2-4 weeks for Western media pickup IF pitched effectively
   - No fallback if Western media doesn't respond (besides zh.wikipedia or Wikinews)
   - This creates sequencing tension with M3.1/M3.2 viral launch (Week 1)

2. **Western Media Outreach Not M3.3's Scope:**
   - Strategy document identifies need but doesn't provide journalist pitch tactics
   - Cross-reference to M3.2 growth tactics (journalist outreach) but not integrated into Wikipedia timeline
   - CEO responsibility flagged but no handoff protocol specified

3. **V2 Expansion Phases Under-Detailed:**
   - Phase 2 (Weeks 3-6): "Add autopsy details, family response" - which specific facts? In what order?
   - Phase 3 (Months 2-3): "Add censorship section" - how to avoid NPOV disputes when adding controversial content post-acceptance?
   - Missing: trigger conditions for each phase (e.g., "expand Phase 2 only after 0 deletion nominations for 2 weeks")

4. **Alternative Strategies If Western Media Fails:**
   - zh.wikipedia (Chinese Wikipedia) option mentioned but not detailed
   - Wikinews option mentioned but no strategy provided
   - "Mention in related articles" tactic mentioned but no target article list
   - Timeline: If no Western media by Week 8, what's the backup plan?

**Integration with Phase 2:**
- ✅ V2 article integrates Western Framework Angle 3 (grandmother), Angle 1 (99.5% surgery) as core facts
- ✅ Omits controversial angles (profit motive, censorship details) from initial submission - aligns with Authority Framework (give officials space)
- ⚠️ Expansion phases will need Phase 2 narrative guidance (how to add censorship section without POV)

**Integration with M3.1:**
- ⚠️ Limited: Wikipedia is separate track from viral content, but viral success could provide sources
- ✅ If M3.1 tactics generate Western media coverage, that directly unblocks M3.3 Wikipedia submission
- Missing: Explicit linkage ("viral content goal = generate Western media sources for Wikipedia")

**Integration with M3.2:**
- ✅ Strong: M3.2 journalist outreach targets (NYT, BBC, CNN) are exactly what M3.3 needs for Wikipedia
- ⚠️ Timing conflict: M3.2 suggests Week 1 journalist outreach, M3.3 suggests submit Wikipedia after media coverage (Week 3-4)
- Missing: Coordinated timeline (pitch journalists Week 1-2, wait for articles Week 2-3, submit Wikipedia Week 4)

**V2 vs. V1 Assessment:**
- **V2 is strategically superior** for acceptance probability (65-75% vs. 30-40%)
- V2 shorter length = less attack surface (88% reduction)
- V2 Tier 1-only sources = harder to challenge (zero Zhihu, zero Vision Times)
- V2 phased expansion = builds community trust vs. comprehensive-from-start (which invites scrutiny)
- CEO directive ("successful submission FIRST, completeness SECOND") perfectly executed

**Production Readiness:**
- **V2 Article:** Ready for copy-paste into Wikipedia sandbox (proper markup, all technical requirements met)
- **Blocker:** Awaiting 2-3 Western media sources (CEO responsibility via M3.2 journalist outreach)
- **Timeline:** If Western media responds Week 2-3, Wikipedia submission Week 4-5 is realistic
- **Contingency:** If no Western media by Week 8, zh.wikipedia or Wikinews (but lower strategic value)

**Grade Rationale:** Exceptional strategic work with V2 pivot demonstrating adaptive realism. Wikipedia expertise evident (GNG analysis, NPOV compliance, precedent comparison, proper markup). Deductions for Western media dependency (blocker not solved, just identified) and expansion phase under-specification. Very close to A, held back by integration gaps with other Phase 3 agents.

## Integration Assessment: Do M3.1, M3.2, M3.3 Work Together?

### Overall Integration: **B+ (Strong with sequencing tensions)**

### What Works Well:

1. **Shared Priority on Grandmother Photo (Angle 3):**
   - M3.1: "10/10 viral potential, deploy first, Tuesday 7pm EST"
   - M3.2: Angle 3 in top-tier cold outreach materials (Instagram carousel, TikTok script)
   - M3.3: V2 Wikipedia article leads with grandmother photo context (core emotional fact)
   - **Assessment:** Perfect alignment. All three agents independently identified grandmother photo as breakthrough asset.

2. **Evidence-First Approach:**
   - M3.1: Hook formulas emphasize documentary proof ("autopsy revealed")
   - M3.2: Value-first outreach provides fact sheet before asking for coverage
   - M3.3: V2 article sticks to proven facts only, omits speculation
   - **Assessment:** Consistent strategy. All three prioritize credibility over virality.

3. **Platform-Specific Optimization:**
   - M3.1: TikTok (FYP mechanics), Instagram (Reels/Explore), YouTube (Shorts→Long-form), Twitter (threads)
   - M3.2: Cold outreach prioritized by platform (Instagram DMs highest response, Twitter for journalists)
   - M3.3: Wikipedia as separate long-term credibility track (not viral, but permanent)
   - **Assessment:** Complementary. No conflicts in platform strategy.

4. **Journalist Targeting:**
   - M3.1: Twitter thread timing optimized for journalist pickup (9-11am EST, tag @nytimes @BBCNews)
   - M3.2: Journalist outreach Tier 1 priority (50 contacts Week 1, 10-15% response rate expected)
   - M3.3: Needs journalists to unblock Wikipedia (2-3 major outlets required)
   - **Assessment:** Strong integration. Journalist outreach serves both viral amplification AND Wikipedia credibility.

### What Creates Tension:

1. **Week 1 Launch vs. Wikipedia Timeline (Sequencing Conflict):**
   - **M3.1:** Deploy Angle 3 Tuesday Week 1, 7pm EST (viral launch)
   - **M3.2:** Journalist outreach Week 1, expect responses Week 2-3, articles published Week 2-4
   - **M3.3:** Cannot submit Wikipedia until 2-3 Western outlets cover story (Week 3-4 at earliest)
   - **Conflict:** If viral launch Week 1 generates media Week 2-3, Wikipedia submission Week 4+ is feasible. BUT if journalists don't respond OR respond but don't publish, Wikipedia blocked indefinitely.
   - **Resolution Needed:** Clarify sequencing: (1) Pitch journalists Week 1 with press kit, (2) Launch viral content Week 1-2, (3) Wait for journalist articles Week 2-3, (4) Submit Wikipedia Week 4. OR accept Wikipedia may be Month 2-3 if media slow.

2. **Influencer Dependency vs. Zero-Contact Reality (Strategy Conflict):**
   - **M3.1:** Viral mechanics include "influencer collaboration hooks" and "expected influencer pickups" as amplification
   - **M3.2 V2:** CEO has zero influencer contacts, influencer partnerships deprioritized (0-1 Week 1, 3-5 Week 4)
   - **Conflict:** M3.1's optimistic reach (30-50M with influencer pickups) assumes influencer amplification that M3.2 V2 says is unlikely
   - **Resolution Needed:** M3.1's conservative reach (10-20M) doesn't depend on influencers and aligns with M3.2 V2 organic-first strategy. Use conservative projections, treat influencers as bonus.

3. **Censorship Angle Timing (Political Sensitivity):**
   - **M3.1:** Angle 2 ("What They Don't Want You To See") has 7/10 viral potential, deploy Week 2
   - **M3.2 V2:** Journalists first (quiet outreach) before public censorship angle (aligns with Phase 2 Authority Framework)
   - **M3.3:** V2 article omits censorship details initially (external link only), adds in Phase 3 expansion
   - **Tension:** If M3.1 deploys censorship angle Week 2 publicly, does this hurt M3.2 journalist quiet outreach or M3.3 Wikipedia NPOV positioning?
   - **Resolution Recommended:** Hold Angle 2 until Week 3-4 (after journalist outreach complete). Deploy Angle 3 (grandmother) and Angle 1 (99.5% surgery) Week 1-2 first (less political, pure emotion/evidence).

### Critical Integration Gaps:

1. **No Master Timeline Across All Three Agents:**
   - M3.1 provides Week 1-4 deployment sequence (Angle 3 → Angle 1 → Angle 7)
   - M3.2 provides Week 1 action list (journalist outreach, Reddit posts, organic seeding)
   - M3.3 provides Wikipedia submission timeline (Week 4+ after Western media)
   - **Gap:** These three timelines are not coordinated into single master calendar
   - **Impact:** Risk of timing conflicts (e.g., viral launch before journalist pitches ready, or Wikipedia submission before articles published)
   - **Resolution Needed:** Phase 4 Production Brief Creator (M4.0) must create integrated Week 1-8 calendar

2. **Success Metrics Not Cross-Calibrated:**
   - M3.1: 10-20M reach (conservative), 30-50M (optimistic with influencers)
   - M3.2 V2: 1M reach achievable without influencers (organic + paid + journalists)
   - M3.3: Not reach-focused, but needs 2-3 Western outlets (implies significant reach to attract journalists)
   - **Gap:** No clear definition of "success" that all three agree on
   - **Resolution Needed:** Define Phase 3 success metrics: (1) 1M+ organic reach Week 1-4 (M3.1 conservative + M3.2 baseline), (2) 2-3 journalist articles published Week 2-4 (M3.2 + M3.3), (3) Wikipedia article live by Week 8 (M3.3 contingent on #2)

3. **Contingency Plans Not Aligned:**
   - M3.1: If organic doesn't hit algorithm, boost with paid ads
   - M3.2 V2: If influencers don't respond, pivot to journalists + organic + paid
   - M3.3: If Western media doesn't materialize, submit to zh.wikipedia or Wikinews
   - **Gap:** What if ALL contingencies needed simultaneously? (organic fails, influencers don't respond, journalists don't publish)
   - **Resolution Needed:** Tiered contingency: Tier 1 = organic + paid ($500-1000 guarantees 100K reach minimum), Tier 2 = zh.wikipedia (lower strategic value but still credibility), Tier 3 = sustained Reddit + community building (slow burn)

### Integration Grade: **B+ (Strong with actionable improvements needed)**

**Rationale:** All three agents align on core strategy (evidence-first, grandmother photo priority, journalist targeting). Major tensions are timing (Week 1 launch vs. Wikipedia Week 4+) and expectations (influencer dependency). These are solvable through master timeline coordination and realistic success metrics. Not A because integration work left to Phase 4 coordinator rather than built-in during Phase 3.

---

## Actionability Assessment: Can Phase 4 Execute Based on These Frameworks?

### M3.1 Viral Mechanics: **YES - Immediately Actionable**

**What Phase 4 Content Creators Can Do Today:**
- ✅ Use 15 hook formulas for Angle 1, 3, 7 content (no guesswork, specific templates provided)
- ✅ Apply pattern interrupt timing (3s, 15s, 30s marks) to 60-second videos
- ✅ Follow posting schedule (Tuesday 7pm EST for Angle 3, Sunday 6pm for Angle 1)
- ✅ Implement hashtag strategy (3-5 tags: niche + trending + campaign-specific)
- ✅ Use thumbnail templates for YouTube (emotional face + shocking text formulas)
- ✅ Write Twitter threads using 15-20 tweet structure with quote-tweet bait

**Missing for Full Execution:**
- ⚠️ Video transcription of 21 existing files (Phase 1 blocker carried forward) - limits documentary B-roll
- ⚠️ A/B testing infrastructure (need to set up analytics tracking, small paid audience for thumbnail tests)
- ⚠️ Audio selection (trending sounds need platform research Week 1, not specified in M3.1)

**Blockers:** None critical. Workarounds exist for all gaps.

**Readiness Score: 95%**

---

### M3.2 Growth Tactics: **MOSTLY - Needs Prioritization Refinement**

**What Phase 4 Can Execute Today:**
- ✅ Journalist outreach: 50 contacts using provided email template (expect 5-8 responses)
- ✅ Reddit posting: 5-10 subreddits with Imgur album format (expect 1-2 to hit 1K+ upvotes)
- ✅ Organic TikTok/Instagram: 3-5 posts optimized for algorithm (FYP/Explore tactics)
- ✅ Value-First Content Kit: Fact sheet, TikTok script, Instagram carousel creation (one-time setup)
- ✅ Paid amplification: $100-500 budget split (Spark Ads, Instagram carousel, Google Ads)

**Challenging for Execution:**
- ⚠️ Week 1 action list has 20+ items across 5 tiers (overwhelming for single executor)
- ⚠️ Cold outreach volume (200-300 influencers identified, 50-100 contacted) is labor-intensive
- ⚠️ Community building (Discord, Facebook Group, Telegram setup + activation) requires ongoing management
- ⚠️ Follow-up sequences (Day 3, Day 7, Day 14) need calendar reminders + CRM tracking

**Missing for Full Execution:**
- ⚠️ Prioritization matrix: Which of 20+ Week 1 tasks are must-do vs. nice-to-have?
- ⚠️ DM template A/B testing (response rates untested, may need refinement after Week 1)
- ⚠️ Budget allocation specifics (if $500 total, how to split across TikTok/Instagram/Google?)
- ⚠️ Community activation playbook (how to get 500 members to share weekly beyond "ask them to")

**Blockers:** Execution complexity. Single human executor cannot do all 20+ Week 1 tasks. Needs prioritization: "If you can only do 5 things Week 1, do these."

**Readiness Score: 75% (Would be 90% with prioritization refinement)**

---

### M3.3 Wikipedia: **NO - Blocked on Western Media**

**What Phase 4 Can Do Today:**
- ✅ V2 article is ready (415 words, proper markup, can copy-paste to Wikipedia sandbox immediately)
- ✅ AfC defense talking points prepared (responses to "not notable," "current event," "why so short?")
- ✅ Expansion roadmap clear (Phase 2: +300 words autopsy/family, Phase 3: +800 words censorship/reform)

**Cannot Execute Today:**
- ❌ Cannot submit Wikipedia article without 2-3 major Western outlets (NYT, BBC, CNN, Reuters, AP)
- ❌ Western media outreach is M3.2's scope, not M3.3's (no integrated handoff)
- ❌ Timeline: 2-4 weeks minimum for journalist pitch → response → article publication → Wikipedia submission

**Blocker Resolution Path:**
1. **Week 1-2:** CEO executes M3.2 journalist outreach (50 contacts, expect 5-8 responses)
2. **Week 2-3:** Journalists who respond research story, interview family, write articles (1-2 week timeline typical)
3. **Week 3-4:** Articles published in 2-3 outlets → M3.3 can now submit Wikipedia with citations
4. **Week 4-5:** M3.3 submits to AfC, responds to reviewer, article goes live (1-2 week review typical)
5. **Week 8+:** Wikipedia article live, begin Phase 2 expansion

**Contingency if Journalists Don't Publish:**
- Month 2: Submit to zh.wikipedia (Chinese Wikipedia) with 68 domestic sources (lower strategic value but builds credibility)
- Month 3: Submit to Wikinews (current events platform, lower bar for sources)
- Month 6: Wait for legal case resolution or anniversary coverage (November 2026)

**Blockers:** Critical dependency on external actors (journalists). M3.3 has done everything in their control. Wikipedia readiness is 100% but submission readiness is 0% until journalists publish.

**Readiness Score: 0% (Execution-Ready) / 100% (Preparation-Ready)**

---

### Overall Phase 4 Actionability: **YES - with sequencing adjustments**

**Immediate Phase 4 Tasks (Week 1):**
1. **Content Production (M3.1):** Create Angle 3, Angle 1, Angle 7 videos/posts using viral mechanics
2. **Organic Seeding (M3.2):** Post Reddit (5-10 subreddits), TikTok (3-5 videos), Instagram (3-5 Reels)
3. **Journalist Outreach (M3.2):** Email 50 journalists using template, follow up Day 3
4. **Monitoring:** Track which content hits FYP/Explore, which Reddit posts gain traction

**Week 2-3 Tasks:**
5. **Journalist Follow-Up:** Day 7, Day 14 sequences, provide press kit to interested journalists
6. **Viral Optimization:** Boost best-performing content with $100-500 paid ads
7. **Community Building:** Set up Discord/Facebook Group, recruit first 50-100 members from engaged commenters

**Week 4-8 Tasks:**
8. **Wikipedia Submission (M3.3):** Once 2-3 journalist articles published, submit V2 article to AfC
9. **Influencer Outreach (M3.2):** Contact 50-100 more influencers (cumulative 150-200), expect 3-5 partnerships
10. **Sustained Pressure:** Deploy Angle 2 (censorship), Angle 5 (290K followers) if needed

**Blocker Management:**
- If organic fails Week 1-2 → Activate paid amplification ($500 minimum)
- If journalists don't respond Week 2-3 → Increase volume to 100 contacts, try freelancers
- If influencers don't respond Week 1-4 → Accept 0-1 partnerships, focus on organic + journalists
- If Western media doesn't publish by Week 8 → Submit Wikipedia to zh.wikipedia OR wait for Month 2-3

**Verdict:** Phase 4 can execute viral launch + journalist outreach + organic seeding immediately. Wikipedia follows 3-4 weeks later contingent on journalist success. Actionability is HIGH for 80% of Phase 3 intelligence, BLOCKED for 20% (Wikipedia submission).

## Gaps & Blockers Flagged

### Critical Blockers (Must Resolve Before Full Execution):

1. **M3.2 Execution Complexity:**
   - **Issue:** Week 1 action list has 20+ items across 5 tiers (journalists, NGOs, influencers, organic, paid)
   - **Impact:** Single human executor cannot complete all tasks (8-10 hours/day for 7 days minimum)
   - **Resolution:** Create prioritization matrix: "Must-do (5 tasks), Should-do (10 tasks), Nice-to-have (5 tasks)"
   - **Owner:** CEO or Phase 4 Production Brief Creator
   - **Timeline:** 2-4 hours to create prioritized Week 1 checklist

2. **M3.3 Western Media Dependency:**
   - **Issue:** Wikipedia V2 article ready but cannot submit without 2-3 major Western outlets
   - **Impact:** Wikipedia timeline (Week 4+) depends on journalist success (Week 2-3)
   - **Resolution:** CEO prioritizes M3.2 journalist outreach Week 1-2 as critical path for Wikipedia unblocking
   - **Owner:** CEO
   - **Timeline:** 2-4 weeks (Week 1-2 outreach, Week 2-3 journalist article publication, Week 4+ Wikipedia submission)

3. **Master Timeline Integration:**
   - **Issue:** M3.1 deployment calendar, M3.2 outreach sequence, M3.3 Wikipedia timeline are separate
   - **Impact:** Risk of timing conflicts (e.g., viral launch before journalist pitches ready)
   - **Resolution:** Phase 4 Production Brief Creator must build integrated Week 1-8 master calendar
   - **Owner:** M4.0 Production Brief Creator (Phase 4 kickoff)
   - **Timeline:** 4-6 hours to consolidate three timelines into single calendar

### Significant Gaps (Lower Priority, Work Around):

4. **Video Analysis Incomplete (Phase 1 Blocker Carried Forward):**
   - **Issue:** 21 video files cataloged but not transcribed/analyzed (limits documentary B-roll options)
   - **Impact:** Phase 4 content creators missing potential viral moments in existing video footage
   - **Workaround:** Focus on photo assets (grandmother photo, before/after baby photos) which M3.1 identifies as highest viral potential anyway
   - **Resolution:** Commission video transcription service (Rev.com, Otter.ai) for 21 files
   - **Timeline:** 3-5 days, $50-100 cost

5. **DM Template Testing Needed:**
   - **Issue:** M3.2 cold outreach templates provided but not A/B tested (response rates are assumptions)
   - **Impact:** Week 1 outreach may have lower-than-expected response if templates don't resonate
   - **Workaround:** Test 3 template versions in first 20 contacts, scale winner for remaining 80 contacts
   - **Resolution:** Build feedback loop (track responses by template variation, refine Week 2)
   - **Timeline:** Week 1 testing, Week 2 optimization

6. **Community Activation Playbook Sparse:**
   - **Issue:** M3.2 mentions Discord/Facebook Group but minimal operational guidance on activation
   - **Impact:** Community may be set up but inactive (500 members but low weekly sharing participation)
   - **Workaround:** Use existing community management best practices (weekly prompts, recognition/gamification, exclusive updates)
   - **Resolution:** Phase 4 assigns community manager role (even if part-time) with weekly activation tasks
   - **Timeline:** Ongoing throughout campaign

### Strategic Gaps (Noted for Future Consideration):

7. **Influencer Dependency in M3.1 Optimistic Projections:**
   - **Issue:** M3.1's optimistic reach (30-50M) assumes influencer pickups, but M3.2 V2 shows influencer partnerships unlikely (0-1 Week 1, 3-5 Week 4)
   - **Impact:** May create false expectations if CEO targets 30-50M reach
   - **Resolution:** Use M3.1 conservative projections (10-20M) aligned with M3.2 V2 organic-first strategy
   - **Recommendation:** Treat influencer amplification as bonus, not baseline assumption

8. **Reddit Strategy Under-Developed in M3.1:**
   - **Issue:** M3.1 focuses heavily on TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter but Reddit is under-covered
   - **Impact:** M3.2 prioritizes Reddit as high-ROI (1K+ upvotes = journalist pickup) but M3.1 doesn't provide Reddit-specific viral mechanics
   - **Workaround:** M3.2's Reddit guidance (post timing, title formulas, Imgur album format) is sufficient for execution
   - **Resolution:** Not blocking, but future Phase 3 work could integrate Reddit more deeply

9. **Budget Allocation Not Specified:**
   - **Issue:** M3.2 provides $100-500 paid amplification tactics but doesn't specify budget split
   - **Impact:** Phase 4 executor unclear if they have $100 total (prioritize TikTok Spark Ads) or $500 (add Instagram + Google Ads)
   - **Workaround:** Use M3.1 viral coefficient predictions to prioritize ad spend (boost Angle 3 first, then Angle 1)
   - **Resolution:** CEO clarifies budget: "We have $X for Week 1-4, spend $Y on organic boost, $Z on cold audience acquisition"

---

## Readiness for Phase 4: **YES (Conditional on Prioritization + Timeline)**

### What's Ready for Phase 4:

✅ **Content Production (M3.1):**
- Angle 3, Angle 1, Angle 7 viral mechanics blueprints complete
- Hook formulas, pattern interrupts, posting times, hashtag strategies all actionable
- YouTube thumbnail templates, Twitter thread structures, TikTok FYP tactics ready

✅ **Organic Amplification (M3.2):**
- Reddit post format (Imgur album + timing + subreddit targets)
- TikTok/Instagram algorithm optimization (FYP tactics, Explore Page tactics)
- Value-First Content Kit creation (fact sheet, scripts, carousel templates)

✅ **Journalist Outreach (M3.2):**
- Email templates, target identification, follow-up sequences
- Expected response rates (10-15% for journalists, realistic expectations set)
- Press kit format (landing page, press release, media contact)

✅ **Wikipedia Preparation (M3.3):**
- V2 article draft ready (415 words, proper markup)
- AfC defense talking points prepared
- Expansion roadmap clear (Phase 2-3 growth plan)

### What's Blocked Pending CEO Action:

⏳ **Prioritization Matrix (M3.2):**
- Week 1 has 20+ action items - needs "must-do vs. should-do vs. nice-to-have" triage
- **Recommendation:** CEO or M4.0 Production Brief Creator creates 1-page Week 1 checklist (5 must-do tasks)
- **Timeline:** 2-4 hours, must happen before Phase 4 kickoff

⏳ **Master Timeline Integration:**
- M3.1 deployment calendar (Week 1: Angle 3, Week 2: Angle 1, Week 3: Angle 7)
- M3.2 outreach sequence (Week 1: journalists/Reddit/organic, Week 2: follow-ups)
- M3.3 Wikipedia timeline (Week 4+ submission after Western media)
- **Recommendation:** M4.0 creates integrated Week 1-8 calendar showing all three tracks in parallel
- **Timeline:** 4-6 hours, must happen at Phase 4 kickoff

⏳ **Western Media Unblocking (M3.3):**
- Wikipedia V2 ready but needs 2-3 major Western outlets (NYT, BBC, CNN, Reuters, AP)
- **Recommendation:** CEO prioritizes M3.2 journalist outreach Week 1-2 (50 contacts, expect 5-8 responses, 2-3 articles)
- **Timeline:** 2-4 weeks (Week 1-2 outreach, Week 2-3 article publication, Week 4+ Wikipedia submission)

### Conditions for Phase 4 "GO":

**Minimum Viable (Can Start Today):**
1. ✅ Pick 5 Week 1 must-do tasks from M3.2 (e.g., journalist outreach, Reddit posting, organic TikTok, paid boost if budget available)
2. ✅ Create Angle 3 content using M3.1 mechanics (Tuesday 7pm EST launch)
3. ✅ Set up journalist outreach workflow (email list, templates, calendar reminders)
4. ✅ Accept Wikipedia will be Week 4+ (contingent on journalist success)

**Ideal (Requires 1-2 Days Prep):**
1. ✅ CEO or M4.0 creates prioritized Week 1 checklist (5 must-do, 10 should-do, 5 nice-to-have)
2. ✅ M4.0 builds integrated Week 1-8 master calendar (combining M3.1 deployment + M3.2 outreach + M3.3 Wikipedia timeline)
3. ✅ CEO confirms budget ($100? $500? $1000?) for paid amplification Week 1-4
4. ✅ CEO assigns roles (if multiple humans): Content creator (M3.1), Outreach coordinator (M3.2), Community manager, Wikipedia submitter (M3.3 Week 4+)

**Recommendation:** Phase 4 can start immediately in "Minimum Viable" mode (Angle 3 content + journalist outreach + organic seeding). Prioritization refinement and master timeline happen in parallel Week 1-2 (doesn't block Day 1 execution).

### CEO Decision Required:

**Option A: Start Phase 4 Today (Minimum Viable)**
- Pros: Momentum maintained, Week 1 launch possible (Angle 3 Tuesday)
- Cons: Execution complexity high (20+ tasks, no prioritization), risk of overwhelm
- Recommendation: If CEO has confidence in executor(s) to self-prioritize, GO

**Option B: 2-Day Prep Before Phase 4 (Ideal)**
- Pros: Prioritization clear, master timeline integrated, roles assigned
- Cons: 2-day delay (Week 1 launch becomes Week 2)
- Recommendation: If CEO wants maximum execution efficiency and lower risk, PREP FIRST

**Lieutenant's Recommendation:** **Option A (Start Today) with parallel prioritization refinement**
- Rationale: Phase 3 intelligence is 90% actionable. The 10% gaps (prioritization, timeline integration) can be worked on in parallel without blocking Day 1 execution. Delaying 2 days for "perfect prep" loses momentum and doesn't significantly reduce risk (executors can self-prioritize top 5 tasks from M3.2 obvious choices: journalists, Reddit, organic seeding, Angle 3 content, paid boost).

---

## Recommendations to CEO

### Immediate Actions (Today):

1. **Authorize Phase 4 Kickoff - Minimum Viable Mode**
   - Assign Phase 4 Production Brief Creator (M4.0) to consolidate Phase 3 intelligence
   - M4.0 first task: Create prioritized Week 1 checklist (5 must-do tasks from M3.2's 20+ items)
   - M4.0 second task: Build integrated Week 1-8 master calendar (M3.1 + M3.2 + M3.3 timelines)
   - Timeline: M4.0 spends 6-8 hours Day 1-2 creating Production Brief, then hands off to platform strategists (M4.1-M4.8)

2. **Clarify Budget for Paid Amplification (M3.2)**
   - Question: What is total budget for Week 1-4 paid ads?
   - Options: $100 (minimal, boost 1 video), $500 (moderate, boost 3-5 pieces), $1000+ (aggressive, multi-platform)
   - Recommendation: $500 minimum for Week 1-4 split as: $200 TikTok Spark Ads (boost Angle 3), $200 Instagram carousel (targeting parents 30-55), $100 Google Ads (journalist keywords)
   - Rationale: $500 guarantees 80K-120K reach even if organic fails. This is safety net for M3.2 V2 strategy (don't depend on influencers, use paid as baseline).

3. **Prioritize Journalist Outreach Week 1-2 (Critical Path for Wikipedia)**
   - Action: CEO or designated human executes M3.2 journalist outreach (50 contacts using email template)
   - Targets: Medical reporters, China correspondents, investigative journalists (list provided by M3.2)
   - Expected: 5-8 responses Week 1-2, 2-3 articles published Week 2-3
   - Impact: Unblocks M3.3 Wikipedia submission Week 4+ (needs 2-3 Western outlets)
   - Timeline: 4-6 hours Week 1 (email 50 journalists), 2 hours Day 3 (follow-ups), 2 hours Day 7 (follow-ups)

### Strategic Decisions (Week 1):

4. **Align on Realistic Success Metrics (M3.1 + M3.2 Calibration)**
   - Question: What does "success" look like for Phase 3 execution?
   - Conservative Target (M3.1 + M3.2 V2 Aligned): 1M+ organic reach Week 1-4, 2-3 journalist articles, Wikipedia live by Week 8
   - Optimistic Target (If Influencer Bonus Happens): 5M+ reach, 5-10 journalist articles, 3-5 influencer partnerships
   - Breakthrough Target (Viral + Media Storm): 10M+ reach, mainstream media coverage (NYT/BBC/CNN), Wikipedia live Week 4
   - Recommendation: Set expectation at Conservative, celebrate if Optimistic/Breakthrough achieved
   - Rationale: M3.2 V2 shows influencer partnerships unlikely (0-1 Week 1), so Conservative target doesn't depend on them

5. **Hold Censorship Angle (Angle 2) Until Week 3-4**
   - Issue: M3.1 suggests Angle 2 Week 2, but M3.2 V2 + Phase 2 Authority Framework suggest quiet journalist outreach first
   - Recommendation: Deploy Angle 3 (grandmother) and Angle 1 (99.5% surgery) Week 1-2 (emotional + evidence, non-political)
   - Deploy Angle 2 (censorship) Week 3-4 ONLY IF journalists haven't responded OR as escalation pressure after initial outreach
   - Rationale: Censorship angle is political (triggers defensive response from authorities). Emotional angles (grandmother) and evidence angles (autopsy) build credibility first, then escalate if needed.

6. **Accept Wikipedia May Be Month 2-3 (Not Week 4)**
   - Issue: M3.3 timeline assumes 2-4 weeks for journalist response + article publication, but this is optimistic
   - Reality: Journalists may take 3-4 weeks to respond, another 1-2 weeks to write/publish (total 4-6 weeks)
   - Recommendation: Target Wikipedia submission Week 6-8 (realistic), celebrate if Week 4 achievable (bonus)
   - Contingency: If no Western media by Week 8, submit to zh.wikipedia (Chinese Wikipedia) with 68 domestic sources (lower strategic value but builds credibility baseline)

### Execution Refinements (Week 1-2):

7. **Create DM Template Feedback Loop**
   - Issue: M3.2 cold outreach templates untested (2-5% response rate is assumption)
   - Action: Test 3 template variations in first 20 Instagram DMs, track response rates, scale winner for remaining 80+ contacts
   - Expected: One template will have 5-8% response (double the expected 2-5%), scale that version
   - Timeline: Week 1 testing (20 contacts, 3 variations), Week 2 scaling (80+ contacts, winner template)

8. **Assign Community Manager Role (Even Part-Time)**
   - Issue: M3.2 mentions Discord/Facebook Group but activation tactics sparse
   - Action: Designate human (or split responsibility) for community management: weekly prompts, engagement, exclusive updates
   - Timeline: Set up Discord/Facebook Group Day 1-2 (2 hours), recruit first 10-20 members from engaged commenters Week 1, grow to 50-100 Week 2
   - Target: 500 engaged members by Week 4 (M3.2 goal), each sharing weekly = 150K-450K organic reach

9. **Video Transcription as Parallel Track (Non-Blocking)**
   - Issue: 21 video files unanalyzed (Phase 1 blocker carried forward)
   - Action: Commission video transcription service (Rev.com, Otter.ai) for 21 files
   - Timeline: 3-5 days, $50-100 cost
   - Impact: Unlocks documentary B-roll, direct family voice clips for future content (Week 2-3)
   - Priority: MEDIUM (Phase 4 can start without this, but improves content quality Week 2+)

### Long-Term Strategic (Month 2-3):

10. **Plan Wikipedia Expansion Phases**
   - Action: Once M3.3 V2 article accepted (Week 4-8), plan Phase 2 expansion (add autopsy details, family response, +300 words)
   - Trigger: Wait 2 weeks after acceptance with no deletion nominations, then expand
   - Timeline: Phase 2 expansion (Week 6-10), Phase 3 expansion (Month 2-3, add censorship section +800 words)
   - Rationale: M3.3 V2 "start small" philosophy requires gradual expansion to avoid NPOV disputes. Don't rush to comprehensive article immediately.

---

## Final Assessment

### Phase 3 Quality Grade: **A-**

**Rationale:**
- **M3.1:** A (Exceptional viral mechanics intelligence, immediately actionable, minor gaps don't block execution)
- **M3.2:** B+ (V2 pivot demonstrates world-class problem-solving, but execution complexity and untested templates prevent A)
- **M3.3:** A- (Strategic realism with V2 minimizes rejection risk, but Western media dependency and integration gaps hold back from A)
- **Integration:** B+ (Strong alignment on grandmother photo priority, evidence-first approach, journalist targeting; tensions on timing and influencer expectations are solvable)

**Weighted Average:** (A + B+ + A- + B+) / 4 ≈ **A-**

### Phase 3 Deliverable Completeness: **90%**

**What Was Delivered:**
- ✅ M3.1: Comprehensive viral mechanics (2,267 lines, platform algorithms, hook formulas, optimization tactics)
- ✅ M3.2: Growth tactics V2 (3,136 lines, cold outreach strategy, alternative growth mechanisms, journalist prioritization)
- ✅ M3.3: Wikipedia strategy + V2 article (strategy 45KB, article-draft-v2 415 words, agent report)
- ✅ Agent reports for all three (clear status, recommendations, blockers flagged)

**What's Missing (10%):**
- ⏳ Master timeline integrating M3.1 deployment + M3.2 outreach + M3.3 Wikipedia (left to Phase 4 M4.0)
- ⏳ Prioritization matrix for M3.2 Week 1 tasks (20+ items need triage)
- ⏳ Video analysis completion (21 files, Phase 1 blocker carried forward)
- ⏳ DM template testing (assumptions need Week 1 validation)

### Phase 4 Readiness: **YES (Conditional)**

**Conditions Met:**
- ✅ Content production frameworks complete (M3.1 viral mechanics)
- ✅ Growth tactics complete (M3.2 organic + paid + journalist strategies)
- ✅ Wikipedia preparation complete (M3.3 V2 article ready, awaiting media trigger)

**Conditions Pending:**
- ⏳ CEO clarifies budget for paid amplification ($100? $500? $1000?)
- ⏳ M4.0 Production Brief Creator consolidates Phase 3 into prioritized Week 1 checklist
- ⏳ CEO or designated human executes journalist outreach Week 1-2 (critical path for Wikipedia)

**Recommendation:** **PROCEED TO PHASE 4 immediately (Minimum Viable Mode)** with parallel prioritization refinement Week 1-2. The 10% gaps (timeline integration, task prioritization) do not block Day 1 execution of top-priority tasks (Angle 3 content, journalist outreach, organic seeding).

### Key Success Factors Going Forward:

1. **Manage Expectations:** Use M3.1 conservative projections (10-20M reach) aligned with M3.2 V2 reality (influencers unlikely). Treat optimistic outcomes as bonus.

2. **Prioritize Ruthlessly:** M3.2 has 20+ Week 1 tasks. Executor must focus on top 5: (1) Journalist outreach, (2) Reddit posting, (3) Organic TikTok/Instagram, (4) Angle 3 content production, (5) Paid boost if budget available.

3. **Execute in Parallel Tracks:** Content production (M3.1) + journalist outreach (M3.2) + organic seeding (M3.2) can all happen Week 1 simultaneously. Wikipedia (M3.3) follows Week 4+ contingent on journalist success.

4. **Monitor and Adapt:** Week 1 is testing phase. If organic doesn't hit algorithm, boost with paid. If journalists don't respond, increase volume to 100 contacts. If influencers don't respond (expected per M3.2 V2), don't panic—strategy doesn't depend on them.

5. **Timeline Realism:** Wikipedia Week 4+ (not Week 2). Journalist articles Week 2-3 (not Week 1). Influencer partnerships Week 4+ (not Week 1). Set realistic milestones to avoid discouragement if early weeks are slow.

---

**Mission Assessment:** Phase 3 agents delivered world-class strategic intelligence with adaptive problem-solving (V2 pivots on growth strategy and Wikipedia approach). Quality is A-level. Execution readiness is high for viral launch + journalist outreach + organic amplification. Wikipedia follows 3-4 weeks later contingent on media coverage. **Phase 4 is cleared for immediate kickoff.**

## FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT: 1 Human + $200 Budget Reality Check

**Assessment Date:** January 14, 2026
**Assessor:** Phase 3 Lieutenant (Resumed Assignment)
**CEO Constraints:** ONE human worker, $200 total budget, 3-month mission window
**Mission Question:** Is this achievable?

---

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: BRUTAL HONESTY

**Short Answer:** NO - not as originally designed.

**The Math Doesn't Work:**
- M3.2 Week 1 action list = 20+ tasks requiring 60-80 hours of expert-level execution
- 1 human working 40 hours/week = impossible to execute all recommendations
- $200 budget = enough for minimal paid amplification OR tools, not both
- 3-month window + zero influencer contacts + zero journalist relationships = unrealistic timeline for "mainstream breakthrough"

**But the Mission Can Succeed IF We:**
1. **Cut 75% of tactics** - Focus on 5-10 MUST-DO actions only
2. **Accept lower reach targets** - 500K reach (not 10M), 1-2 journalist articles (not 5-10)
3. **Prioritize free organic strategies** - TikTok algorithm + Reddit seeding (no paid tools)
4. **Eliminate Week 1 fantasies** - No influencer partnerships, no community infrastructure, no multi-platform launch
5. **Redefine success** - Mission success = 1 NYT article + Wikipedia page + 1M reach (not "systemic reform")

---

## PART 1: ACTIONABILITY ASSESSMENT (1 Human Worker)

### M3.1 Week 1 Reality Check

**Original Week 1 Recommendations:**
- Create 5+ pieces of content across 4 platforms (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter)
- A/B test 3 variations per angle (hook tests, thumbnail tests)
- Post at optimal times (7pm EST daily, research trending sounds)
- Monitor analytics across all platforms
- Respond to comments/DMs to boost engagement velocity
- Create content calendar for Week 2-4

**Time Required:**
- Content creation (5 pieces × 4 platforms = 20 pieces): 40-60 hours
  - Research trending sounds: 2 hours
  - Script writing: 10 hours (30 min per piece)
  - Video editing/image creation: 20 hours (1 hour per piece)
  - Platform-specific optimization: 8 hours
  - Posting + caption writing: 5 hours
  - Analytics setup: 3 hours
- A/B testing infrastructure: 5-8 hours
- Comment management: 10-15 hours/week ongoing

**Total: 55-83 hours for Week 1**

**Reality for 1 Human:**
- 40 hours/week available = CAN'T DO ALL OF THIS
- If human works 60 hours (burnout territory), still cutting corners
- Quality suffers when rushed (defeats purpose of "viral mechanics optimization")

**WHAT MUST BE CUT:**
- ❌ Multi-platform launch (pick ONE platform for Week 1)
- ❌ A/B testing (no time, no budget for test audiences)
- ❌ 5+ pieces Week 1 (aim for 2-3 EXCELLENT pieces instead)
- ❌ Daily posting (2-3x per week maximum)
- ❌ Comment management at scale (reply to top 10 comments only)

**MINIMUM VIABLE WEEK 1 (M3.1):**
1. Choose ONE primary platform: TikTok (best organic reach potential)
2. Create 2-3 pieces using top viral angles (Angle 3 grandmother + Angle 1 surgery)
3. Use free tools only: CapCut (free video editor), Canva Free (images)
4. Post Tuesday 7pm EST, monitor for 48 hours
5. If viral (10K+ views), create follow-up. If not, iterate.

**Time: 15-20 hours Week 1** (achievable)

---

### M3.2 Week 1 Reality Check

**Original Week 1 Recommendations:**
- Contact 50 journalists (cold email, research, personalized pitches)
- Contact 30 NGOs/activists (human rights organizations, medical ethics groups)
- Identify 200-300 influencers, DM 50-100 (Instagram, TikTok research + outreach)
- Seed content on Reddit (5-10 subreddits, research rules, craft posts)
- Post daily on TikTok, Instagram, Twitter (multi-platform content creation)
- Set up Discord server + Facebook Group (community infrastructure)
- Create Content Kit (fact sheet, TikTok script, Instagram carousel, Twitter thread)
- Follow-up sequences (Day 3, Day 7, Day 14 calendar reminders)

**Time Required:**
- Journalist research + outreach: 15-20 hours (50 emails × 20 min each)
- NGO research + outreach: 8-12 hours (30 contacts × 20 min each)
- Influencer research: 10-15 hours (200-300 profiles reviewed)
- Influencer DMs: 8-12 hours (50-100 DMs × 10 min each)
- Reddit research + posting: 8-10 hours (subreddit rules, post crafting, timing)
- Multi-platform content creation: 20-30 hours (see M3.1 above)
- Community infrastructure: 5-8 hours (Discord setup, Facebook Group setup, initial content)
- Content Kit creation: 6-10 hours (fact sheet, templates, design)
- Follow-up system setup: 3-5 hours (spreadsheet, calendar, templates)

**Total: 83-122 hours for Week 1**

**Reality for 1 Human:**
- This is 2-3 WEEKS of full-time work, not 1 week
- M3.2 assumes a TEAM: Outreach coordinator, content creator, community manager
- If human tries to do everything, quality collapses (copy-paste spam emails = 0% response)

**WHAT MUST BE CUT:**
- ❌ Contact 50 journalists (aim for 10 HIGH-PRIORITY targets only)
- ❌ Contact 30 NGOs (cut entirely for Week 1, revisit Week 3-4)
- ❌ Identify 200-300 influencers (aim for 30-50, contact 10-15 only)
- ❌ Multi-platform daily posting (pick ONE platform, post 2-3x/week)
- ❌ Discord + Facebook Group (cut entirely, focus on content not infrastructure)
- ❌ Follow-up sequences (manual only, no automated system Week 1)

**MINIMUM VIABLE WEEK 1 (M3.2):**
1. Research + email 10 journalists (medical reporters, China correspondents)
   - Use M3.2 email template
   - Personalize subject line + first paragraph only
   - Include link to 1-page fact sheet (Google Doc, free)
2. Seed 2-3 Reddit posts (r/MedicalMalpractice, r/China, r/JusticeServed)
   - Use Imgur for photo hosting (free)
   - Post during peak hours (research optimal timing per subreddit)
3. Create basic Content Kit (1-page fact sheet only, no templates)
4. Track responses in simple spreadsheet (no CRM needed)

**Time: 12-18 hours Week 1** (achievable)

---

### M3.3 Week 1 Reality Check

**Original Week 1 Recommendations:**
- Wait for Western media coverage (blocked on M3.2 journalist success)
- Draft article ready (already complete)
- Monitor for international sources (Google Alerts setup)

**Time Required:**
- Monitoring: 2-3 hours/week (passive)

**Reality for 1 Human:**
- M3.3 is NOT a Week 1 task—it's Week 4-8 contingent on journalist success
- If journalists don't respond (likely given cold outreach), Wikipedia blocked for MONTHS

**WHAT MUST BE CUT:**
- ❌ Expectation that Wikipedia submission happens Week 4-6
- ✅ Reality: Wikipedia submission Month 2-3 IF journalists respond

**MINIMUM VIABLE APPROACH (M3.3):**
1. Focus 100% on M3.2 journalist outreach (Wikipedia depends on this)
2. Accept that Wikipedia may NOT happen within 3-month window
3. Contingency: Submit to zh.wikipedia (Chinese Wikipedia) instead if no Western media by Week 8

**Time: 0 hours Week 1-3** (blocked)

---

### COMBINED WEEK 1 TIME BUDGET

**If Human Attempts Everything:**
- M3.1: 55-83 hours
- M3.2: 83-122 hours
- M3.3: 0 hours (blocked)
- **Total: 138-205 hours**

**Available: 40 hours/week × 1 human = 40 hours**

**Gap: 98-165 hours SHORT** (2-4 weeks of additional labor needed)

---

**MINIMUM VIABLE WEEK 1 (Combined):**
- M3.1 (TikTok only): 15-20 hours
- M3.2 (10 journalists + 2-3 Reddit posts): 12-18 hours
- M3.3: 0 hours (not Week 1 task)
- Buffer for unexpected issues: 5-10 hours
- **Total: 32-48 hours**

**Verdict: ACHIEVABLE if we cut 75% of tactics and focus ONLY on:**
1. 2-3 TikTok videos (Angle 3 + Angle 1)
2. 10 journalist emails (high-priority targets)
3. 2-3 Reddit posts (high-engagement subreddits)
4. Basic fact sheet creation (1 page, Google Doc)

---

## PART 2: BUDGET FEASIBILITY ($200 Total)

### M3.2 Paid Amplification Recommendations

**Original Budget Assumptions:**
- $100-500 for Week 1-4 paid amplification
- TikTok Spark Ads: $100-200
- Instagram Ads: $100-200
- Reddit Ads: $50-100
- Google Ads (journalist keywords): $50-100

**Reality Check:**
- $200 total budget = can do ONE of these, not all
- OR spread $50/week for 4 weeks (minimal impact per platform)

---

### Tool/Platform Cost Analysis

**"Free" Tools (Actually Free):**
- CapCut (video editing): FREE
- Canva Free (image design): FREE (limited templates)
- TikTok Analytics: FREE (built-in)
- Google Docs/Sheets: FREE
- Imgur (image hosting): FREE
- Reddit posting: FREE

**"Free" Tools (Freemium with Limits):**
- Canva Pro: $13/month ($40 for 3 months) - needed for premium templates
- Buffer/Hootsuite (scheduling): $15-30/month - NOT NEEDED (manual posting is fine)
- ChatGPT Plus: $20/month ($60 for 3 months) - helpful but not required (free tier exists)

**Paid Tools Phase 3 Assumes:**
- Video editing (Adobe Premiere): $22/month - NOT NEEDED (use CapCut free)
- Image design (Photoshop): $22/month - NOT NEEDED (use Canva free)
- Analytics (SocialBlade Pro): $10/month - NOT NEEDED (platform built-in analytics sufficient)

**AI Tools M3.2 Mentions:**
- Midjourney (image generation): $10/month - Optional, not required
- ElevenLabs (voice): $5/month - Optional, not required
- Runway (video): $15/month - Optional, not required

---

### $200 Budget Allocation (Realistic)

**Option A: All Organic (Zero Paid Ads)**
- Tools: $0 (use all free tools)
- Paid ads: $0
- Reserve: $200 for Month 2-3 if viral traction proven
- **Strategy:** Bet 100% on organic TikTok algorithm + Reddit viral potential

**Option B: Minimal Tools + Minimal Ads**
- Canva Pro: $40 (3 months) - premium templates for Instagram carousels
- Paid ads: $160 split across 4 weeks = $40/week
  - Week 1: $40 TikTok Spark Ad (boost best-performing video)
  - Week 2: $40 TikTok Spark Ad (if Week 1 successful)
  - Week 3: $40 Instagram Ad (if pivoting platforms)
  - Week 4: $40 reserve
- **Strategy:** Hybrid—organic focus with paid boost for proven winners

**Option C: Frontload Paid Ads (Risky)**
- Tools: $0 (all free)
- Week 1 paid ads: $100 TikTok Spark Ads (aggressive early push)
- Week 2-4 reserve: $100 (only spend if Week 1 shows ROI)
- **Strategy:** Buy initial visibility, hope organic algorithm takes over

---

**RECOMMENDATION: Option A (All Organic)**

**Reasoning:**
- $200 is too small for meaningful paid reach ($40/week = ~3K-8K impressions, not game-changing)
- Paid ads require PROVEN content (need to know what works before spending money)
- TikTok algorithm is meritocratic—if content is good, it will reach 10K+ organically for free
- Better to save $200 for Month 2 crisis (e.g., "we're at 500K reach, $200 boost could push to 1M")

**What Gets Cut:**
- ❌ TikTok Spark Ads Week 1-4
- ❌ Instagram Ads
- ❌ Reddit Ads
- ❌ Google Ads
- ❌ Canva Pro (use Free tier, accept limited templates)
- ❌ ANY paid AI tools (use free ChatGPT, free Canva, free CapCut)

**What This Means:**
- 100% reliance on organic reach (TikTok FYP, Reddit upvotes, journalist cold emails)
- Success depends entirely on content quality + algorithm favor
- If content doesn't organically hit 10K+ views Week 1-2, campaign likely fails

---

## PART 3: MISSION FEASIBILITY (3-Month Window)

### Phase 3 Timeline vs. Reality

**Original Mission Timeline:**
- Week 1-2: Viral content launch + journalist outreach
- Week 3-4: First journalist articles published (2-3 outlets)
- Week 5-8: Mainstream breakthrough (100K+ followers, 5-10 journalist articles)
- Week 8-12: Chinese authority acknowledgment + systemic reform

**Reality Check Questions:**

**Q1: Can 1 human + $200 generate "viral content" Week 1-2?**
- MAYBE if grandmother photo (Angle 3) hits TikTok FYP algorithm
- TikTok is meritocratic—content quality matters more than budget
- But: No guarantee (even great content can fail algorithmically)
- **Probability: 30-50%** (dependent on execution quality + luck)

**Q2: Can cold email journalist outreach generate 2-3 articles Week 3-4?**
- M3.2 predicts 10-15% response rate for journalists (cold outreach)
- 10 journalists contacted = expect 1-2 responses, 0-1 article commitments
- Timeline: Journalist responds Week 2 → researches Week 3 → publishes Week 4-6 (optimistic)
- **Probability: 20-40%** (most journalists ignore cold pitches)

**Q3: Can mainstream breakthrough (100K+ followers) happen Week 5-8?**
- Requires: Viral TikTok (500K+ views) OR journalist article in major outlet (NYT, BBC) OR Reddit front page (10K+ upvotes)
- With $0 paid ads and 1 human, this depends on ONE THING going extremely right
- **Probability: 10-25%** (rare but possible—"Grandmother photo" has viral potential)

**Q4: Can Chinese authorities acknowledge + reform within 12 weeks?**
- Even if campaign goes perfectly (viral + media coverage), CCP response timeline is:
  - Local authorities: 2-4 weeks (already happened—provincial work group dispatched)
  - National policy reform: 6-12 MONTHS minimum (legislative process)
- **Probability: <5%** (not enough time for systemic reform even if viral)

---

### Minimum Success Threshold (Realistic)

**Original Mission Goal:**
- Viral social media → Mainstream media → Authority response → Systemic reform

**Revised Mission Goal (Achievable with Constraints):**
- Organic viral content (500K+ reach) → 1-2 journalist articles (regional or niche outlets) → Wikipedia page acceptance → Ongoing pressure

**Success Metrics (Realistic):**
1. **Viral Threshold:** 500K total reach across platforms (Week 1-4)
   - TikTok: 300K+ views on 2-3 videos
   - Reddit: 1 post with 5K+ upvotes
   - Instagram/Twitter: 100K+ impressions
2. **Media Pickup:** 1-2 journalist articles (Sixth Tone, regional US outlets, medical journals)
   - NOT expecting NYT/BBC/CNN (unrealistic for cold outreach + zero budget)
3. **Wikipedia:** Article accepted on en.wikipedia OR zh.wikipedia (Month 2-3)
   - Contingency: Wikinews if journalist articles insufficient
4. **Community:** 5K+ engaged followers across platforms (Week 8-12)
   - NOT expecting 100K+ (unrealistic without influencer partnerships or paid ads)

**What This Achieves:**
- Permanent documentation (Wikipedia page)
- Ongoing pressure (5K followers can sustain campaign beyond 3 months)
- Foundation for future escalation (if family or others take over)

**What This Does NOT Achieve:**
- Chinese authority policy reform (unrealistic timeline)
- Mainstream Western media saturation (NYT, BBC, CNN)
- Global household name recognition

---

### Blocking Factors (What Could Kill the Mission)

**Blocker 1: Organic Content Fails to Go Viral (Week 1-3)**
- If TikTok videos get <10K views, algorithm won't push further
- If Reddit posts get <500 upvotes, no journalist pickup
- **Probability: 50-70%** (most content doesn't go viral)
- **Mitigation:** Iterate quickly (3-5 different hooks Week 1-2, find what works)

**Blocker 2: Journalists Ignore Cold Emails (Week 2-4)**
- If 0/10 journalists respond, no media coverage
- If no media coverage, Wikipedia blocked indefinitely
- **Probability: 60-80%** (cold email response rates are brutal)
- **Mitigation:** Increase volume (contact 20-30 journalists Week 2-3), try freelancers (higher response rates)

**Blocker 3: Censorship Escalates (Anytime)**
- If Chinese government pressures platforms (TikTok, Reddit moderators)
- If family's Douyin account deleted (290K followers lost)
- **Probability: 20-40%** (CCP has history of suppressing viral stories)
- **Mitigation:** Archive everything, multi-platform redundancy, Western platforms primary focus

**Blocker 4: Human Burnout (Week 2-4)**
- 1 human working 50-60 hours/week for 3 months = burnout territory
- If human gets sick, takes break, or loses motivation, campaign stalls
- **Probability: 30-50%** (sustainable pace is 30-40 hours/week)
- **Mitigation:** Build in rest weeks, focus on minimum viable actions, accept slower pace

---

## PART 4: PRIORITIZATION MATRIX (What to CUT)

### MUST DO (Week 1-4) - CRITICAL PATH

**These 10 actions are NON-NEGOTIABLE:**

1. **Create 2-3 TikTok videos** (Angle 3 grandmother + Angle 1 surgery)
   - Use free CapCut editor
   - Post Tuesday 7pm EST (optimal timing per M3.1)
   - Focus: Grandmother photo (15-30s), 99.5% surgery hook (45-60s)

2. **Email 10 journalists** (medical reporters, China correspondents)
   - Use M3.2 email template (personalize subject + first paragraph)
   - Include link to 1-page fact sheet (Google Doc)
   - Follow up Day 7 if no response

3. **Create 1-page fact sheet** (Google Doc, shareable link)
   - Timeline of events
   - Key autopsy findings (diagnosis discrepancy, patch left inside)
   - High-res photo links (grandmother, baby before/after)
   - Social media links (mother's Douyin account)

4. **Seed 2-3 Reddit posts** (r/MedicalMalpractice, r/China, r/JusticeServed)
   - Imgur album (grandmother photo + timeline images)
   - Post title: "A baby died in China. The autopsy proved the surgery was unnecessary."
   - Post during peak hours (per subreddit research)

5. **Monitor TikTok analytics** (daily for first 48 hours post-publication)
   - If video hits 10K+ views, create follow-up immediately
   - If <1K views after 48 hours, iterate (new hook, different angle)

6. **Track all outreach in spreadsheet** (journalist emails, Reddit post performance, TikTok metrics)
   - Simple columns: Date, Contact, Platform, Response (Y/N), Notes
   - No fancy CRM needed

7. **Create 2-3 Instagram Reels** (if TikTok successful Week 1-2)
   - Reformat top TikTok content for Instagram
   - Use Canva Free for caption graphics
   - Post Wednesday/Sunday 6pm EST

8. **Follow up with journalists** (Day 7, Week 2)
   - If 0 responses, increase volume to 20-30 contacts
   - Try freelancers (higher response rate than staff reporters)

9. **Respond to top Reddit comments** (if post gets 100+ upvotes)
   - Answer questions, provide sources
   - Steer conversation toward "share this story"

10. **Reserve $200 for Month 2** (only spend if proven traction)
    - If TikTok video hits 100K+ views Week 2-3, use $100-200 for Spark Ads boost
    - If no traction by Week 4, save for crisis/opportunity

---

### NICE TO HAVE (Week 2-4) - Do if Time Allows

**These actions AMPLIFY success but aren't required:**

11. Contact 5-10 NGOs (human rights organizations, medical ethics groups)
12. Create Instagram carousel (10-slide fact sheet design)
13. Write Twitter thread (8-tweet template)
14. Identify 30-50 micro-influencers (research only, no DMs yet)
15. Set up Google Alerts (monitor for media pickup)
16. Create TikTok Account Bio optimization (profile, story highlights)
17. Post 1-2 YouTube Shorts (if TikTok content reformattable)
18. Engage with medical professional communities (Zhihu, Reddit r/medicine)
19. Archive family's Douyin content (follow archiving instructions.md)
20. Translate top 5 Chinese articles (using Claude, document in translations/)

**Time Estimate: 15-25 hours**
**Do only if Week 1-2 MUST-DO items completed ahead of schedule**

---

### CUT ENTIRELY (At Least for Month 1)

**These tactics are TOO RESOURCE-INTENSIVE for 1 human + $200:**

❌ Discord server setup
❌ Facebook Group setup
❌ Community manager role (responding to all DMs/comments)
❌ Influencer DM outreach (50-100 contacts)
❌ Multi-platform daily posting (TikTok + Instagram + Twitter + YouTube)
❌ A/B testing infrastructure
❌ Paid ads Week 1-2 (save budget for proven winners)
❌ Video analysis of all 21 files (nice to have, not critical)
❌ Canva Pro subscription ($40 for 3 months)
❌ Any paid AI tools (Midjourney, ElevenLabs, Runway)
❌ Scheduling tools (Buffer, Hootsuite)
❌ CRM for tracking outreach
❌ Hiring freelancers (no budget)
❌ Attending conferences/events (no budget)
❌ Printing materials (no budget)
❌ Domain/website hosting (use Google Docs/free platforms)

**Reasoning:** These are "nice to have" tactics that require time/money we don't have. Focus on MINIMUM VIABLE CAMPAIGN: Great content + journalist outreach + Reddit seeding. Everything else is distraction.

### Expected Outcomes (Conservative, Realistic)

**Week 1 Outcomes:**
- TikTok video #1: 5K-20K views (if algorithm favorable)
- TikTok video #2: 10K-50K views (if hook strong)
- Reddit post: 200-2K upvotes (if subreddit receptive)
- Journalist responses: 0-2 (10-15% of 10 contacts)

**Week 2-4 Outcomes:**
- TikTok cumulative: 50K-200K views (if 1-2 videos hit FYP)
- Reddit cumulative: 500-5K upvotes (if 1 post goes front page)
- Journalist articles: 0-1 (optimistic: 1 regional or niche outlet)
- Instagram/Twitter: 10K-50K impressions (if expanding Week 3-4)

**Month 2-3 Outcomes:**
- TikTok cumulative: 200K-500K views (sustained content + iterations)
- Total reach: 500K-1M (cross-platform)
- Journalist articles: 1-2 (regional outlets, medical journals, NOT NYT/BBC)
- Wikipedia: Article submitted, pending review (contingent on journalist success)

**What This Does NOT Achieve:**
- 10M+ reach (requires influencer partnerships or viral breakthrough)
- Mainstream media saturation (NYT, BBC, CNN - unrealistic for cold outreach)
- Chinese authority systemic reform (timeline too short)

---

## PART 6: MISSION FEASIBILITY VERDICT

### Is the 3-Month Mission Achievable?

**Short Answer: NO - not as originally designed (mainstream breakthrough + systemic reform)**

**But a REVISED Mission IS Achievable:**

**Revised Mission:**
- Generate 500K-1M organic reach (credible, sustainable)
- Secure 1-2 journalist articles (regional/niche outlets, NOT tier 1)
- Get Wikipedia page accepted (en.wikipedia or zh.wikipedia)
- Build 5K+ engaged community (ongoing pressure foundation)

**This Revised Mission:**
- ✅ Is achievable with 1 human + $200 + 3 months
- ✅ Creates permanent documentation (Wikipedia)
- ✅ Establishes foundation for future escalation
- ✅ Keeps family's story alive beyond 3-month window
- ❌ Does NOT achieve "Chinese authority systemic reform" (unrealistic timeline)

---

### What Needs to Change from Original Phase 3 Strategy

**M3.1 Changes:**
- ❌ Multi-platform launch (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter Week 1)
- ✅ Single-platform focus (TikTok only Week 1-2, expand Week 3-4 if successful)
- ❌ 5+ pieces of content Week 1
- ✅ 2-3 EXCELLENT pieces Week 1 (quality over quantity)
- ❌ A/B testing infrastructure
- ✅ Manual iteration (if video flops, try different hook Week 2)

**M3.2 Changes:**
- ❌ Contact 50 journalists + 30 NGOs + 50-100 influencers Week 1
- ✅ Contact 10 journalists + 0 NGOs + 0 influencers Week 1 (focused outreach)
- ❌ Discord + Facebook Group + Community infrastructure
- ✅ Zero community infrastructure (focus 100% on content + outreach)
- ❌ $100-500 paid ads Week 1-4
- ✅ $0 paid ads Week 1-4 (reserve $200 for proven winners only)
- ❌ Expect 2-3 journalist articles Week 3-4
- ✅ Expect 0-1 journalist article Week 4-8 (realistic for cold outreach)

**M3.3 Changes:**
- ❌ Wikipedia submission Week 4-6
- ✅ Wikipedia submission Month 2-3 (contingent on journalist success)
- ❌ Expect 2-3 major Western outlets (NYT, BBC, CNN)
- ✅ Expect 1-2 regional/niche outlets (Sixth Tone, medical journals)
- ❌ English Wikipedia only
- ✅ zh.wikipedia contingency if English Wikipedia blocked

---

### Success Redefined

**Original Success Definition:**
- Viral social media → Mainstream media → Chinese authority acknowledgment → Systemic reform

**Revised Success Definition:**
- Organic viral content (500K+ reach) → 1-2 journalist articles → Wikipedia page → Ongoing pressure foundation

**Minimum Success Threshold:**
- 1 TikTok video with 100K+ views (proves viral potential)
- 1 journalist article published (regional outlet acceptable)
- Wikipedia page accepted (en.wikipedia OR zh.wikipedia)
- 5K+ engaged followers (can sustain campaign beyond 3 months)

**If We Achieve This:**
- Story is permanently documented (Wikipedia)
- Family has ongoing platform (5K followers)
- Foundation exists for future escalation (if others join, if resources increase)
- Mission continues beyond 3-month window (sustainable pace)

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO CEO

### Immediate Decision Required

**Option A: Proceed with REVISED Mission (Recommended)**
- Accept lower targets (500K reach, not 10M)
- Accept longer timeline (Wikipedia Month 2-3, not Week 4-6)
- Accept minimum viable tactics (TikTok + Reddit + 10 journalists, no community infrastructure)
- **Probability of Success: 40-60%** (realistic but not guaranteed)

**Option B: Abort Mission**
- Acknowledge constraints make mainstream breakthrough impossible
- Archive materials for future use (when resources increase)
- Hand off to others (activists, NGOs with more resources)

**Option C: Delay Mission 1-2 Months**
- Use Month 1 to build resources (recruit volunteers, raise small budget, establish relationships)
- Launch Month 2-3 with stronger foundation
- Risk: Story loses momentum, censorship escalates

---

### If CEO Chooses Option A (Revised Mission)

**CEO Must Accept:**
1. **Lower reach targets:** 500K reach (not 10M), 1-2 journalist articles (not 5-10)
2. **Longer Wikipedia timeline:** Month 2-3 (not Week 4-6), contingent on journalist success
3. **No mainstream breakthrough:** Regional outlets (not NYT/BBC/CNN), niche impact (not global)
4. **No systemic reform within 3 months:** Timeline too short for CCP policy change
5. **Human burnout risk:** 1 human working 40-50 hours/week for 3 months = exhaustion

**CEO Should Approve:**
- ✅ Minimum Viable Launch Plan (10-item Week 1 checklist above)
- ✅ $200 reserve strategy (spend only on proven winners)
- ✅ Single-platform focus (TikTok Week 1-4, expand only if successful)
- ✅ Journalist outreach priority (10 contacts Week 1, increase if no responses)
- ✅ Revised success metrics (500K reach + 1 article + Wikipedia page = mission success)

**CEO Should REJECT:**
- ❌ Multi-platform daily posting
- ❌ Community infrastructure (Discord, Facebook)
- ❌ Influencer outreach (zero contacts, no time, low ROI given cold outreach)
- ❌ Paid ads Week 1-2 (wait for proof of concept)
- ❌ Expectation that mainstream media will cover (NYT/BBC unlikely with cold outreach)

---

### Critical Path for Success

**Week 1-2: PROVE VIRAL POTENTIAL**
- If TikTok video hits 50K+ views, algorithm is working → double down
- If TikTok video gets <5K views, iterate quickly → try 3-5 different hooks
- If Reddit post hits front page (5K+ upvotes), journalists will notice organically
- If 0/10 journalists respond, increase volume to 20-30 contacts Week 2-3

**Week 3-4: SECURE 1 JOURNALIST ARTICLE**
- If journalist responds Week 2, follow up aggressively Week 3
- If no responses by Week 3, try freelancers (higher response rate)
- If journalist commits to article, provide all materials (fact sheet, photos, translations)
- Article publication Week 4-6 = Wikipedia unblocked

**Week 5-8: WIKIPEDIA SUBMISSION + SUSTAINED CONTENT**
- If journalist article published, submit Wikipedia Week 5-6
- If no journalist article, submit zh.wikipedia OR wait for Month 3 legal developments
- Continue TikTok content (2-3x/week) to sustain 5K+ follower base
- If $200 unused, spend on boosting top-performing content Week 6-8

**Week 9-12: ONGOING PRESSURE**
- Wikipedia page live (if successful)
- 5K+ followers sustained through weekly content
- Campaign continues beyond 3-month window (lower intensity, sustainable pace)
- Hand off to others if burn out (materials documented for future activists)

---

### Honest Assessment of Failure Probability

**Probability Mission FAILS (Even Revised Version):**
- **50-60%** - Most campaigns don't go viral, most cold emails are ignored, most Wikipedia submissions need multiple revisions

**Primary Failure Modes:**
1. **Content doesn't go viral** (TikTok algorithm doesn't push, Reddit downvotes)
   - Mitigation: Iterate quickly (5-10 different hooks Week 1-4)
2. **Journalists ignore cold emails** (0/30 respond even with follow-ups)
   - Mitigation: Try freelancers, medical journals, bloggers (lower bar)
3. **Censorship escalates** (Chinese government pressures platforms, family's account deleted)
   - Mitigation: Archive everything, multi-platform redundancy
4. **Human burnout** (1 human can't sustain 40-50 hours/week for 12 weeks)
   - Mitigation: Build in rest weeks, accept slower pace

**If Mission Fails:**
- Materials are documented (Phase 1-3 intelligence preserved)
- Wikipedia draft ready (can submit in future when sources materialize)
- Narrative frameworks proven (Western/Chinese/Authority angles tested)
- Lessons learned for future activists (what works, what doesn't)

---

## CONCLUSION

**The mission AS DESIGNED in Phase 3 is NOT feasible with 1 human + $200 + 3 months.**

**But a REVISED mission IS feasible:**
- Organic viral content (500K reach) via TikTok algorithm + Reddit seeding
- 1-2 journalist articles via persistent cold outreach (regional/niche outlets)
- Wikipedia page via journalist coverage (Month 2-3, contingent)
- 5K+ engaged community as ongoing pressure foundation

**This revised mission:**
- Keeps family's story alive
- Creates permanent documentation
- Establishes foundation for future escalation
- Is achievable with focused execution and realistic expectations

**CEO must decide:**
- Accept revised mission (lower targets, longer timeline, minimum viable tactics)
- OR abort/delay mission (insufficient resources for original goals)

**Phase 3 Lieutenant's recommendation:**
- ✅ **PROCEED with revised mission**
- ✅ Approve Minimum Viable Launch Plan (Week 1 checklist above)
- ✅ Accept 40-60% success probability (realistic, not guaranteed)
- ✅ Focus: Great content + journalist outreach + Wikipedia = achievable with constraints

**The grandmother photo alone has viral potential. The autopsy proof is ironclad. The mission CAN succeed—just not at the scale originally envisioned.**
