## TIER 2: STRONGLY SUPPORTED CLAIMS (State with Attribution)

### AUTOPSY VS. HOSPITAL DIAGNOSIS DISCREPANCY

**Hospital's Pre-Surgery Diagnosis (as reported):**
~7mm coronary sinus-type atrial septal defect requiring surgery
Surgeon told family: 99.5% success rate
Expected duration: Under 3 hours

**Autopsy Findings Published by Family (December 19):**
NO coronary sinus defect found
Only 3mm secundum atrial septal defect
1.4 × 0.5 cm pericardial patch found inside heart
6.5 cm surgical wound unsutured

**Evidence:** Sixth Tone (independent journalism), Vision Times, Yangcheng Evening News (Source #050), Tencent News (Sources #005, #006), Zhihu medical analysis (Source #015)
**Verification Status:** ⚠️ STRONGLY SUPPORTED - Family published findings, reported by multiple credible outlets

**Western Usage:**
Use attribution: "According to autopsy findings published by the family and reported by multiple news outlets, no coronary sinus defect was found..."

**Why Not Tier 1:**
Autopsy report published by family, not directly by official forensic center. However, multiple news outlets confirmed findings and no official denial issued.

---

### MEDICAL NECESSITY QUESTION

**Expert Opinion on 3mm Secundum ASD:**
"Typically resolves on its own without surgery"
"More than 80% healing naturally within a year" in infants

**International Standards Discussion:**
Zhihu medical professionals debating: "Did Xiao Luoxi need immediate surgery?"
Analysis comparing to international pediatric cardiology guidelines
Some professionals questioned necessity after autopsy revealed 3mm defect

**Evidence:** Vision Times (citing medical sources), Zhihu threads (Sources #022, #025, #065) with medical professional participation
**Verification Status:** ⚠️ STRONGLY SUPPORTED - Medical literature + professional discussion

**Western Usage:**
Attribute to medical sources: "According to medical experts cited by Vision Times, 3mm secundum atrial septal defects in infants typically resolve on their own..."

**Why Not Tier 1:**
Medical opinion/literature citation, not official medical examiner finding on THIS specific case.

---

### RECORD FALSIFICATION ALLEGATIONS

**Family's Formal Legal Complaint (Dec 28) Alleges:**
1. Medical records show timeline inconsistencies
2. Post-operative documentation appears altered
3. Missing critical entries during deterioration period
4. Discrepancies between different record sets
5. Records state "all patches removed" but autopsy found patch inside heart

**Father's Statement:**
Records were "openly falsified" (公然伪造)

**Evidence:** Legal objection documents (D007-D008), Vision Times article
**Verification Status:** ⚠️ STRONGLY SUPPORTED - Formal legal filing + autopsy contradicts records on patch

**Western Usage:**
Attribute to family: "The family filed a formal legal objection alleging that medical records were falsified, pointing to the autopsy finding of a patch inside the heart despite records stating all patches were removed."

**Why Not Tier 1:**
Allegation made by family in legal filing, not officially adjudicated. However, autopsy finding re: patch provides strong supporting evidence.

---

### UNDISCLOSED SECOND SURGERY

**Official Investigation Finding:**
A second surgical procedure was performed during operation
Family was never informed before, during, or after

**Evidence:** Sixth Tone article (citing official investigation), multiple news reports
**Verification Status:** ⚠️ STRONGLY SUPPORTED - Reported as official investigation finding by credible journalism

**Western Usage:**
Attribute to investigation: "According to the official investigation, a second surgical procedure was performed without the family's knowledge or consent."

**Why Not Tier 1:**
Reported by independent journalism citing official findings, not direct access to official investigation report text.

---

### COMMUNICATION FAILURES DURING SURGERY

**Timeline of Communications (as reported):**
~4:00 PM: Family told surgery "not going smoothly," only "50% survival"
~4:30 PM: Family told surgery "successful, stable vital signs"
~10:03 PM: Child declared dead

**Evidence:** Sixth Tone article (investigative journalism)
**Verification Status:** ⚠️ STRONGLY SUPPORTED - Credible investigative reporting

**Western Usage:**
Attribute to reports: "According to reports, the family received conflicting information within 30 minutes during the surgery..."

**Why Not Tier 1:**
Family account reported by journalism, not independently verified medical records of communications.

---

### HOSPITAL COMPENSATION OFFER

**Reported Offer:**
10,000 RMB (~$1,400 USD) refund

**Family Response:**
"We are not seeking compensation. We only want the truth." - Father

**Evidence:** incident.md, multiple reports
**Verification Status:** ⚠️ STRONGLY SUPPORTED - Widely reported, consistent across sources

**Western Usage:**
Use "according to reports": "According to reports, the hospital offered 10,000 RMB (approximately $1,400 USD) to the family, which they rejected..."

**Why Not Tier 1:**
Reported by multiple sources but no official document confirming offer amount.

---

### MEDICAL COMMUNITY RESPONSE SHIFT

**Zhihu Discussion Pattern:**
Initial defenders of hospital/doctors
After autopsy published: Many reversed positions or went silent

**Evidence:** Zhihu thread "Colleagues defending hospital went silent after autopsy" (Source #018)
**Verification Status:** ⚠️ STRONGLY SUPPORTED - Observable shift in major discussion forum

**Western Usage:**
Attribute to social media: "According to discussions on Zhihu (Chinese Quora), some medical professionals who initially defended the hospital reversed their positions after the autopsy findings were published."

**Why Not Tier 1:**
Social media observation, not systematic survey of medical professional opinion.

---

## TIER 3: ALLEGATIONS (Must Clearly Attribute & Qualify)

### FALSE DIAGNOSIS ALLEGATION

**Family's Position:**
Hospital falsely diagnosed coronary sinus-type ASD to justify unnecessary surgery

**Supporting Evidence:**
Autopsy found no such defect

**Hospital Position:**
Not publicly addressed in detail

**Investigation Finding:**
Did not specifically address diagnosis accuracy

**Western Usage:**
Clearly attribute: "The family alleges the hospital falsely diagnosed a coronary sinus-type atrial septal defect to justify surgery, pointing to autopsy findings that showed no such defect existed."

**Why This Tier:**
Family's interpretation of discrepancy between diagnosis and autopsy. Plausible but not officially adjudicated as "false diagnosis" vs. "diagnostic error."

---

### COVER-UP ALLEGATION

**Family's Position:**
Hospital and local authorities engaged in systematic cover-up
Evidence of falsified records
Investigation whitewashed findings

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Deleted hospital statement
- Censored articles
- Investigation's limited scope
- Autopsy contradicts records

**Western Usage:**
Attribute and provide evidence: "The family alleges a systematic cover-up, citing the hospital's deletion of its public statement, the censorship of critical articles, and what they characterize as a limited investigation that failed to address key questions."

**Why This Tier:**
"Cover-up" is interpretation of behavior pattern. Individual actions verified (deletion, censorship) but "systematic cover-up" characterization is family's allegation.

---

### INVESTIGATOR CONFLICT OF INTEREST

**Family/Public Concern:**
Local investigators may have financial or institutional ties to hospital
Health Commission investigates hospitals it oversees

**Evidence:**
Structural relationship exists; specific conflicts not documented

**Western Usage:**
Frame as concern: "The family and some observers have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, noting that the Ningbo Health Commission investigated a hospital it oversees."

**Why This Tier:**
Reasonable concern about structural conflict, but specific improper influence not proven.

---

### POLICE INTIMIDATION CLAIMS

**Photo Evidence:**
Image of police officer confronting crying mother
Mother on street with sign saying "Don't hit us"

**Context:**
Photos exist but full circumstances unclear

**Western Usage:**
Describe visuals, let audience interpret: "Photos show police confronting the grieving mother during her public advocacy, which the family characterizes as intimidation."

OR: "A photo captioned 'Don't hit us' shows the mother pleading during a public appearance."

**Why This Tier:**
Visual evidence of confrontation exists, but "intimidation" characterization is interpretation. Context not fully known.

---

### MULTIPLE DEATHS AT HOSPITAL (BROADER CLAIM)

**NTD TV Report (Dec 17):**
Claims 5 children died on operating table
Another 5-year-old died from IV drip

**Verification:**
One additional case confirmed (5-year-old fever case)
Full scope not independently verified

**Western Usage:**
Conservative approach: "At least one additional death of a 5-year-old has been separately reported at the same hospital."

OR: "Overseas media outlet NTD TV reported multiple deaths at the same hospital, though the full scope of these claims has not been independently verified."

**Why This Tier:**
NTD TV is single source for broader claim. One additional death confirmed, but "5 children" figure not corroborated by other outlets.

---

## TIER 4: SPECULATION (Avoid or Clearly Mark)

**These should be AVOIDED in factual reporting or clearly marked as speculation:**

### Financial Motive for Unnecessary Surgery
**Speculation:** Hospital had financial incentive to perform unnecessary procedures
**Evidence:** None direct; inferred from pattern
**Recommendation:** Avoid stating without evidence OR frame as question: "Questions have been raised about whether financial incentives may have influenced medical decisions."

### Deliberate vs. Negligent Malpractice
**Speculation:** Whether malpractice was deliberate negligence or incompetence
**Evidence:** Cannot be determined from available evidence
**Recommendation:** Stick to documented facts about what happened, avoid speculating on intent.

### Surgeon's Training/Background Issues
**Speculation:** Surgeon lacked proper training or experience
**Evidence:** No information available on Chen Junxian's background
**Recommendation:** Do not speculate without evidence.

### Future Legal/Political Outcomes
**Speculation:** Will there be criminal charges? Will family win lawsuit? Will central government intervene?
**Evidence:** Case ongoing; outcomes unknown
**Recommendation:** Report current status only; avoid predictions.

---

## CONFLICTING INFORMATION - HOW TO PRESENT

### Hospital Diagnosis vs. Autopsy

**Hospital claimed:** 7mm coronary sinus-type ASD
**Autopsy found:** No coronary sinus defect, only 3mm secundum ASD

**Accurate Presentation:**
"The hospital diagnosed a 7mm coronary sinus-type atrial septal defect before surgery. However, according to autopsy findings published by the family and reported by multiple news outlets, no coronary sinus defect was found—only a 3mm secundum atrial septal defect, a different and milder condition."

---

### Surgery Success Communications

**4:00 PM:** "Not going smoothly," 50% survival
**4:30 PM:** "Successful, stable vital signs"
**10:03 PM:** Death

**Accurate Presentation:**
"According to reports, the family was first told around 4:00 PM that the surgery was not going smoothly and their baby had only a 50% chance of survival. Just 30 minutes later, they were told the surgery was successful with stable vital signs. The baby died at 10:03 PM the same day."

---

### Patch Removal

**Medical records:** "All patches removed"
**Autopsy finding:** 1.4 × 0.5 cm patch found inside heart

**Accurate Presentation:**
"Medical records state that all surgical patches were removed, but according to autopsy findings, a 1.4 × 0.5 cm pericardial patch was found inside the heart. The family filed a formal legal objection alleging record falsification."

---

### Investigation Characterization

**Official finding:** "Insufficient risk assessment, surgical errors, delayed communication"
**Family/public view:** Whitewash of false diagnosis, unauthorized surgery, falsified records

**Accurate Presentation:**
"The official investigation characterized the incident as involving 'insufficient risk assessment, surgical errors, and delayed communication with family.' However, critics argue this characterization fails to address key questions including the accuracy of the pre-surgical diagnosis, the undisclosed second surgery, and allegations of falsified medical records."

---

- Official autopsy findings
- Official investigation results and disciplinary actions
- Provincial intervention
- Department closure
- Celebrity statements
- Legal filings
- Censorship events (with CDT archive evidence)
- Timestamped photo/video evidence

**⚠️ TIER 2 Claims - MUST Attribute:**

- Medical necessity question ("According to medical experts...")
- Record falsification ("The family alleges in legal filing...")
- Undisclosed second surgery ("According to official investigation...")
- Communication timeline ("According to reports...")

**⚠️⚠️ TIER 3 Claims - MUST Clearly Attribute AND Qualify:**
- False diagnosis allegation ("The family alleges...")
- Cover-up allegation ("The family characterizes as...")

---

## RED FLAGS - DO NOT STATE WITHOUT VERIFICATION

❌ "The hospital deliberately gave false diagnosis for profit" → Financial motive unproven
❌ "Five children died on operating table" → Only 1-2 deaths independently confirmed
❌ "Investigators were bribed" → Conflict of interest concern exists, but no proof of bribery
❌ "This is systematic corruption" → Pattern exists but "corruption" requires proof
❌ "The baby would definitely have healed without surgery" → Expert opinion says likely, not certain
❌ "Criminal charges will be filed" → Ongoing; no indication yet
❌ "The doctor was incompetent" → No background information available
