## TIMELINE: BIRTH TO TRAGEDY

### May 26, 2025
**Baby Luoxi Born**
- **Full Name:** Xu Luoxi (许洛熙)
- **Gender:** Female
- **Birth Status:** Premature (34 weeks, 6 days gestation)
- **Location:** Zhejiang Province, China
- **ID Number:** 330283202505260320

**Source:** Autopsy report (Tab 3)
**Human Review:** ✓ VERIFIED

---

### May - November 2025
**Early Medical Monitoring**
- Regular checkups at Ningbo University First Affiliated Hospital and Ningbo Women & Children's Hospital
- Heart murmur detected during routine examination
- Parents told baby has atrial septal defect (hole in heart)
- Medical records span 120 pages covering this period

**Context for Western Audiences:**
Heart murmurs are common in infants and often resolve naturally. Parents were likely told this was routine monitoring initially.

**Source:** Medical Record Part 1 (120 pages), family accounts
**Human Review:** ⚠️ MODERATE - Exact diagnosis date unclear

---

### Pre-November 11, 2025
**Hospital Recommends Immediate Surgery**

**Chinese Original:**
"医生告知家属约7毫米冠状窦型房间隔缺损，需要手术。外科医生称'成功率约99.5%'，'3小时以内完成'"

**English Translation:**
Doctor informed family of approximately 7mm coronary sinus-type atrial septal defect requiring surgery. Surgeon stated "success rate of about 99.5%" and would be completed "within 3 hours."

**Doctor's Pressure Tactics (as reported by family):**
- Baby would develop cerebral palsy without immediate surgery
- Called it "entry-level surgery" with "almost no risk"
- Described as minimally invasive procedure
- Urgent intervention necessary

**Western Context:**
This sales-pitch approach would raise red flags for Western medical ethics (informed consent requires balanced risk discussion, not sales tactics). The urgency claim contradicts international pediatric cardiology guidelines.

## TIMELINE: HOSPITALIZATION & DEATH

### November 11, 2025
**Hospital Admission**
- Baby admitted to Ningbo Women & Children's Hospital for scheduled surgery
- Pre-surgical testing conducted:
  - Blood type: A positive, RH(D) positive
  - Chest X-ray: No abnormalities
  - Coagulation tests: Normal
  - Liver/kidney function: Normal
- Baby in stable condition

**Father's Real-Time Posts:**
Father began posting minute-by-minute updates on Weibo (Chinese Twitter), documenting family's emotional state and medical updates in real-time.

**Western Context:**
Pre-surgical testing showing "all normal" is significant—indicates baby was healthy going into an elective procedure.

### November 14, 2025 - Morning
**The Day of Surgery**

**7:48 AM** - Baby taken into operating room
**9:25 AM** - Surgery begins (Room #12)

**Surgical Team:**
- **Chief Surgeon:** Chen Junxian (陈君贤) [later dismissed]
- **Assisting Surgeons:** Dan Jiantao (但建韬), Yang Jiameng (杨嘉梦)
- **Anesthesiologists:** Yang Zhongsai (杨忠赛), Li Fanling (李凡灵), Guang Haiya (广海雅)

### November 14, 2025 - Afternoon (Surgery Goes Wrong)

**~4:00 PM (Approximately 6.5 hours into surgery)**

**Chinese Original:**
"家属被告知手术'进展不顺利'，婴儿'只有50%存活机会'"

**English Translation:**
Family told surgery "had not gone smoothly" and baby had only "50% chance of survival."

**Western Context:**
This is dramatically different from the promised 99.5% success rate. Parents had been waiting for 6+ hours at this point, already double the promised time.

**UNDISCLOSED SECOND SURGERY:**
According to official investigation findings, a second surgical procedure was performed during the operation. The family was NEVER informed—not before, during, or after.

**Western Context:**
In Western medical ethics, this is an egregious violation of informed consent. Any additional procedure requires explicit permission unless it's an immediate life-saving measure.

**Source:** Sixth Tone article, official investigation
**Human Review:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Exact nature of second surgery unclear

---

**~4:30 PM (30 minutes later)**

**Chinese Original:**
"仅30分钟后，家属被告知手术'成功'，生命体征'稳定'"

**English Translation:**
Just 30 minutes later, family told surgery was "successful" with "stable vital signs."

**Emotional Whiplash:**
Parents went from "50% survival chance" to "successful surgery" in 30 minutes—devastating emotional roller coaster.

**Western Context:**
This conflicting communication would be considered severe medical communication failure in Western standards.

**English Translation:**
At 11:19 PM on the night of death, mother and grandmother were on the street begging for help.

**Photo Evidence:** Timestamp visible in image "11.14 晚23:19"

**Western Context:**
Just over an hour after their baby died, the grieving mother and grandmother were on the street seeking public assistance. This shows complete institutional abandonment—no hospital support, grief counseling, or social services offered.

**Viral Significance:** This image of midnight desperation hours after losing a child is viscerally powerful across all cultures.

**Report Size:** 21 pages, 7.5MB

**Key Findings:**
1. **Cause of Death:** Cardiac weakness, respiratory failure
2. **Defect Found:** Only 3mm secundum atrial septal defect

5. **Wounds:** 6.5cm chest wound and 5.0cm heart sac wound LEFT UNSUTURED

**English Translation:**
Ningbo Women & Children's Hospital Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery department placed in "closed state" with all surgeries suspended.

**Additional Context (Unverified):**
NTD TV reported claims of 5 other children dying on operating tables at same hospital, plus separate 5-year-old death from IV drip. These broader claims require additional verification.

**Source:** Multiple news outlets (Zhihu, Every Economic Daily, Huxiu, China National Radio, Yicai)

Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee dispatched work group to supervise case handling. Medical malpractice appraisal formally initiated.

**Western Context:**
This is significant escalation in Chinese government hierarchy:
- Local level (Ningbo) → Failed to handle properly
- Provincial level (Zhejiang) → Forced to intervene
- Indicates local cover-up or incompetence

Like when US state or federal government must intervene when local authorities fail.
