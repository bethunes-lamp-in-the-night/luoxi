**Source:** Autopsy report by forensic expert Liu Liang, published December 19, 2025

**Why It's Viral Gold:**
- Viscerally horrifying image
- Clear evidence of negligence
- "Baby bled to death" narrative
- No medical justification possible

### 2. SURGERY WAS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY

Baby had only **3mm heart defect** that has **80%+ natural healing rate**. Doctor scared parents into surgery claiming she'd get cerebral palsy without it.

**Sources:**
- Autopsy report: Only 3mm secundum ASD found
- Chinese medical guidelines: 3-8mm defects have 80%+ natural closure rate

- "She didn't need to die"

**Doctor's Pre-Surgery Claims:**
