## GAPS IN RESEARCH

### What We DON'T Have Yet:
1. **Direct Douyin video archive** - Requires human with account
2. **WeChat group discussions** - Private, need invitation
3. **Full engagement metrics** - Platform internal data
4. **Deleted content screenshots** - Can only confirm via reports
5. **Hospital internal documents** - Leaked materials if they exist
6. **Legal filings** - Court documents if publicly available
7. **Medical records** - Only what family published

### Why These Matter:
- Douyin videos: Most powerful emotional content
- WeChat groups: Shows grassroots organizing
- Engagement metrics: Prove virality
- Deleted content: Evidence of cover-up
- Internal docs: Smoking gun evidence
