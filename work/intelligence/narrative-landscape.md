### 1.2 Western Media Coverage

**Outlets:** Sixth Tone, Vision Times, Mothership SG, Weibo Newsletter

**Dominant Frames:**
- Human rights angle (censorship, cover-up)
- Medical tourism warning
- China system critique
- Individual tragedy

**Gap:** Mainstream Western media (NYT, BBC, CNN) NOT COVERING
**Reason:** Requires translation, China fatigue, no Western connection yet

**Opportunity:** Story ready for Western viral moment with right packaging

---

### 1.3 Family's Narrative

**Primary Channels:**
- Douyin: @小洛熙妈妈 (292,769 followers)
- Weibo: Real-time documentation
- Live streams: Hospital visits, authority interactions

**Core Messages:**
1. "We don't want money, we want truth"
2. Real-time documentation (transparency)
3. Evidence-based (publishing autopsy, medical records)
4. Peaceful advocacy (no violent rhetoric)

**Tone:** Grief + determination, not revenge

**Strengths:**
- Credible (refuses donations - not financially motivated)
- Documented (real-time posts during Nov 11-15)
- Sympathetic (grieving parents)
- Strategic (uses evidence, not just emotion)

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited English-language presence
- Platform-dependent (censorship risk)
- No professional media training visible

---

### 1.4 Medical Professionals' Response

**Platform:** Primarily Zhihu (China's Quora)

**Initial Response (Dec 14-18):** Defensive
- "Surgery was indicated"
- "Complications happen"
- "Don't blame doctors"
- Colleague solidarity with hospital

**POST-AUTOPSY SHIFT (Dec 19+):** Reversal
- Zhihu thread: "Colleagues who defended hospital went silent after autopsy"
- Medical professionals analyzing international guidelines
- Questions about surgical necessity emerging
- Some doctors distancing from case

**Critical Analysis Emerging:**
- International standards: Wait until 2.5-4 years for 3mm ASD
- Chinese guidelines: 80%+ natural closure for this size
- Unsutured wounds "inexplicable" per medical professionals
- Second surgery without consent "illegal"

**Narrative Impact:** Medical community's reversal validates family's claims

---

### 1.5 Authorities' Narrative

**Official Sources:**
- Ningbo Health Commission (Dec 15 investigation results)
- Hospital statement (Dec 20, then DELETED)
- Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee work group (Dec 23)

**Official Frame:** "Administrative failures, not criminal"
- "Insufficient risk assessment"
- "Delayed communication"
- "Record-keeping errors"

**What They're NOT Saying:**
- Whether surgery was necessary
- Why autopsy contradicts pre-op diagnosis
- Whether records were falsified (not just "errors")
- Criminal investigation status

**Tone:** Damage control, minimize, administrative response only

**Public Reception:** REJECTED - seen as whitewash
- Hu Xijin criticized hospital's deleted statement
- Zhihu discussions questioning investigation credibility
- Overseas media calling it "cover-up"

## 5. CENSORSHIP PATTERNS (What's Being Suppressed)

### 5.1 Platform-Specific Censorship

**Xiaohongshu (小红书) - HEAVY SUPPRESSION:**
- Posts actively buried in feeds
- Engagement numbers manipulated (likes disappearing)
- Previous similar cases from same hospital suppressed
- Search results limited
- **Pattern:** Proactive suppression, pre-viral intervention

**WeChat - TARGETED DELETION:**
- Critical commentary articles deleted
- "Patients Cannot Become Test Subjects" article censored Dec 21
- WeChat public account posts removed
- **Pattern:** Reactive deletion of analytical/political content

**Weibo (微博) - MODERATE CONTROL:**
- Some engagement number manipulation
- Hot topic pages require login (reduced spread)
- Individual posts sometimes deleted
- **Pattern:** Selective suppression, allowing some discussion

**Douyin (抖音) - SURPRISINGLY RESILIENT:**
- Mother's account (@小洛熙妈妈) still active with 290K followers
- Live streams functioning
- Father's posts remain
- **Pattern:** Limited censorship, possibly because family is careful with framing

**Hospital/Authorities - SELF-CENSORSHIP:**
- Hospital deleted Dec 20 statement (documented by Hu Xijin)
- Official investigation avoids key questions
- **Pattern:** Consciousness of guilt, damage control

---

### 5.2 Content Type Patterns

**MOST CENSORED:**
1. Political analysis (system critique, CCP failure narratives)
2. Comparative articles (medical systems, international standards)
3. Pattern documentation (other victims, institutional failure)
4. Call-to-action content (organize, protest, petition)

**LEAST CENSORED:**
1. Personal grief posts (family mourning)
2. Celebrity emotional responses (within limits)
3. Medical technical discussion (on Zhihu)
4. Factual timeline posts

**STRATEGY IMPLICATION:** Frame as personal tragedy + medical malpractice, NOT political critique

---

### 5.3 Censorship Resistance

**Working Tactics:**

1. **Live Streaming** (harder to censor in real-time)
   - Mother's Douyin live streams
   - Creates witnesses, harder to delete after

2. **Celebrity Cover** (harder to censor famous voices)
   - Han Hong, He Sui posts remain up
   - Risk: Celebrities could face pressure later

3. **International Archiving** (China Digital Times CDT)
   - 4+ censored articles preserved
   - Creates external record

4. **Platform Diversification** (multi-platform presence)
   - Douyin + Weibo + Xiaohongshu
   - If one censored, others remain

5. **Evidence-Based Framing** (harder to justify censoring facts)
   - Autopsy report (official document)
   - Medical records
   - Investigation results
   - Official announcements

**Failing Tactics:**
1. Analytical/political commentary (quickly deleted)
2. Single-platform reliance (easy to suppress)
3. Unverified claims (gives pretext for deletion)

---

### 5.4 Censorship Opportunities (For Narrative)

**How to Use Censorship as Story:**

1. **"What China Doesn't Want You to Know"** angle
   - Document deletions in real-time
   - Screenshot before deletion
   - Create censorship timeline
   - **Audience:** Western media, anti-censorship advocates

2. **Streisand Effect** (deletion proves importance)
   - Hospital deleted statement = consciousness of guilt
   - "Why would they delete if nothing wrong?"
   - **Audience:** Skeptics, general public

3. **David vs Goliath** (family vs censorship machine)
   - Mother live-streaming as workaround
   - Grassroots ingenuity
   - **Audience:** Social media activists

4. **Archive as Activism** (preserve before deletion)
   - Call to action: Screenshot, share, archive
   - Crowdsourced preservation
   - **Audience:** Tech communities, archivists

---
