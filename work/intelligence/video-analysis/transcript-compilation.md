## CHINESE TEXT EXTRACTED FROM IMAGES

### Priority 1: URGENT TRANSLATION (High Viral Potential)

#### Text 1: Grandmother's Grief Quote
**Source:** Copy of 奶奶给空衣服宝宝喂奶图片.jpg
**Context:** Grandmother feeding empty baby clothes, one week after death at 2am
**Platform:** Xiaohongshu, 2025-11-21 02:05

**Chinese:**
"这钻心的痛 我真的无法承受"

**Literal Translation:**
"This piercing heart pain I really cannot bear"

**Suggested Translation:**
"This heartbreaking pain I really cannot bear"

**Additional Text:**
- Hashtags: "#熬夜喂奶 #养娃不易 特别是早产宝宝更加不容易"
- Translation: "#NightFeeding #RaisingChildrenIsHard especially premature babies even harder"

**Engagement Data:**
- 共281人推荐 (281 recommendations)

**Why Critical:** This quote captures grandmother's unbearable grief. Essential for international emotional impact.

#### Text 2: Mall Protest Sign - Medical Accusations
**Source:** Copy of 图片_20260107104039_269_1.jpg
**Context:** Mother's public protest at shopping mall, January 7, 2026
**Platform:** Xiaohongshu

**Chinese:**
"某妇婴女儿童医院心外科主任陈某贤，手术操作失误致五个月大女儿死亡。手术+抢救长达10小时，是否存在医疗事故+涉嫌篡改病历。"

**Literal Translation:**
"A certain Women & Children's Hospital cardiac surgery director Chen [某]Xian, surgical operation error caused 5-month-old daughter death. Surgery + rescue lasted 10 hours, whether exists medical accident + suspected falsified medical records."

**Suggested Translation:**
"Ningbo Women & Children's Hospital cardiac surgery director Chen XX committed surgical errors causing the death of my 5-month-old daughter. Surgery and emergency intervention lasted 10 hours. Suspected medical malpractice and falsification of medical records."

**Why Critical:** Contains specific legal accusations (surgical error, falsified records). Essential for accountability narrative.

---

#### Text 3: Police Confrontation - Ironic Caption
**Source:** Copy of 警察打洛熙妈妈.jpg
**Context:** Police officer grabbing crying mother holding baby photo
**Platform:** Mobile video screenshot

**Chinese:**
"人民的好警察"

**Literal Translation:**
"The people's good police"

**Suggested Translation:**
"The People's Good Police" (add note: HEAVY SARCASM)

**Why Critical:** Ironic caption creates powerful social critique. Without understanding the sarcasm, image loses its critical meaning. This is social commentary on police brutality against grieving family.

---

#### Text 4: Father's Legal Complaint - Weibo Post
**Source:** Copy of 202525.11.21 洛熙爸爸微博截图.jpg
**Context:** Father's Weibo post, November 21, 2025, 7 days after death
**Posted from:** iPhone, Zhejiang

**Chinese:**
"今日已跟市卫健委打电话 要求书面告知 没有监控 并要求公an介入 以医疗事故罪展开调查，所有参与手术人员一一调查 并且立案 这是我的申诉已提出 (妈妈给你买的小发夹今天终于戴上了)"

**Literal Translation:**
"Today already with city health commission made phone call requesting written notification no surveillance and requesting public security intervention with medical accident crime launch investigation, all participating surgery personnel one-by-one investigate and also file case this is my appeal submitted (Mom bought you small hair clips today finally wore)"

**Suggested Translation:**
"Today I called the Ningbo Health Commission demanding written notification. There is no surveillance footage. I am requesting police intervention to investigate this as a medical malpractice crime. All surgical personnel must be investigated individually and a case must be filed. This is my formal petition.

(Mom, the hair clips you bought for her were finally put on today.)"

**Why Critical:**
- Shows formal legal action taken
- Specific demands documented
- Heartbreaking contrast: Legal language → tender parental detail
- "Hair clips" line is impossibly sad

#### Text 5: Midnight Street Scene - November 14
**Source:** Copy of 2025.11.14 11_19pm 洛熙妈妈奶奶在马路上求助 近图.jpg
**Context:** Close-up of mother/grandmother on street at 11:19pm, night of death
**Platform:** Xiaohongshu

**Chinese:**
"宝宝在医院没了，连最后一面都不给见，有什么猫腻？11月14日半夜跪在马路求真相"

**Literal Translation:**
"Baby in hospital gone, not even last one side also not give see, have what fishy business? November 14 midnight kneel on road seeking truth"

**Suggested Translation:**
"Baby died in the hospital. They didn't even let us see her one last time. What are they hiding? November 14, midnight, kneeling on the street seeking the truth."

**Overlay Text:**
"为母则刚"

**Translation:**
"A mother's strength" OR "When you become a mother, you become strong"

**Why Critical:**
- Timeline evidence (11:19pm, 1 hour after death)
- "Didn't let us see her" = hospital prevented final farewell
- "What are they hiding?" = cover-up accusation
- Powerful context for timestamp photo

#### Text 6: Hospital Pattern - 5-Year-Old Case
**Source:** Copy of 宁波医院5岁孩子高烧过世.jpg
**Context:** News article about another death at same hospital

**Suggested Translation:**
"Ningbo Women & Children's Hospital Faces ANOTHER Father's Complaint! Man Says 5-Year-Old Daughter Died After Fever Treatment"

**Additional Visible Text:**
Text describes pattern: fever → treatment delay → complications → ICU → requested transfer → death

**Bottom Text:**
"举报人：然后把我小孩医死了"

**Translation:**
"Reporter: Then they killed my child through medical treatment"

**Why Critical:**
- SAME HOSPITAL, different child
- "AGAIN" in headline = pattern of negligence
- Strengthens institutional failure narrative
- Prevents dismissal as isolated incident
