They are in what appears to be a hospital hallway with a green lower wall and white upper wall. A large red text overlay with a hospital emoji appears on screen, making serious allegations. The woman continues to wail and scream, her voice hoarse, as the man guides her down the hallway. At one point, a security guard in uniform walks past them in the background.

Use trending audio if appropriate, but ensure it doesn't detract from the gravity of the message.
