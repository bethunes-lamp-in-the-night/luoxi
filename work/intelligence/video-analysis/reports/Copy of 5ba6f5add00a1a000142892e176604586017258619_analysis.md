    The video opens with a young woman in an orange, fluffy jumpsuit, crying hysterically and screaming, supported by a young man in a green jacket. She appears to be in extreme distress, her body shaking and her face contorted in anguish. The man holds her firmly, trying to keep her upright and move her forward. They are in what appears to be a hospital hallway with a green lower wall and white upper wall. A large red text overlay with a hospital emoji appears on screen, making serious allegations. The woman continues to wail and scream, her voice hoarse, as the man guides her down the hallway. At one point, a security guard in uniform walks past them in the background.
