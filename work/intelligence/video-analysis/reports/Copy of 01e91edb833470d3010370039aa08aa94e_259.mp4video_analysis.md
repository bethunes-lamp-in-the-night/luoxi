## 3. Visual Content Analysis

- **Key scenes frame-by-frame:**
    - [00:00 - 02:32] The majority of the video shows a static, light grey tiled wall. Overlaid on this background are live stream elements:
        - **User comments:** Chinese text comments scroll up from the bottom left.
        - **Gift animations:** Various animated gift icons (hearts, tickets, lollipops, etc.) appear and disappear, indicating viewer engagement. These gifts often have a numerical multiplier (e.g., x1, x31, x100).
        - **User profile pictures:** Small circular profile pictures accompany comments and gifts.
        - **Live stream controls:** Small icons (e.g., a "share" icon) are visible at the bottom.
    - [00:03], [00:12], [02:03], [02:10], [02:29] A male face briefly appears at the right edge of the screen, looking slightly upwards. This is likely the streamer or someone next to them, reacting to the conversation or comments. The face shows signs of distress and frustration.
    - [02:11] A "Thuglife" pixelated sunglasses animation briefly appears over the male speaker's face.
- **Visible documents or evidence:** None visible.
- **Protest signs and their text:** None visible.
- **Social media screenshots visible on screen:** The entire video is a screen recording of a social media live stream (likely Douyin/TikTok or a similar platform, given the UI elements and gift system). The comments and user profiles are part of this social media interface.
- **Hospital/government buildings:** None visible.
- **Family grief moments:** The grief is primarily conveyed through the emotional tone of the voices in the audio. Visually, the male speaker's brief appearances show distress.
- **Before/after photos of Luoxi:** None visible.
- **Symbolic imagery:** None visible.
