Visual Content Analysis\n\n*   **Key Scenes Frame-by-Frame:**\n    *   **0:00-0:02:** Wide shot of Ms. Deng kneeling on a tiled public square. She wears an orange jacket and light pants. She holds a large, framed photo of a baby and a white protest sign. Several uniformed police officers and a large crowd surround her.\n    *   **0:02-0:09:** Medium shot of Ms. Deng. Her face is tear-streaked, eyes red. She is visibly distraught, holding the baby's photo close. The photo shows a smiling infant.\n    *   **0:09-0:11:** Police officers in dark uniforms are seen actively trying to pull a red protest sign from Ms. Deng's hands. She resists, clinging to it. Another officer is behind her.\n    *   **0:11-0:19:** Close-up on Ms. Deng's left thigh/hip area, revealing a dark bruise. Her pants are light-colored. The camera angle is low, suggesting she is still on the ground or being held down.\n    *   **0:19-0:22:** Overhead shot looking down at Ms. Deng, who is now lying on her back on the ground, struggling. Her legs are bent, and she's being held by at least one person (partially visible arm/hand). The crowd forms a circle around the immediate struggle.\n    *   **0:27-0:32:** Similar to the opening, Ms. Deng is kneeling, holding the photo and sign. The background shows modern buildings and other pedestrians.\n    *   **0:32-0:37:** Shot from behind a person, showing the backs of several individuals, some in dark jackets, moving through a brightly lit indoor or covered outdoor area. This segment is less clear about Ms. Deng's direct involvement but implies movement or being taken away.\n    *   **0:37-0:55:** Ms. Deng is again on the ground, lying on her back, crying hysterically. Her body is contorted in distress. People stand around her, some looking down. A white, umbrella-like object (possibly a deflated balloon or prop) is on the ground near her.\n    *   **0:55-1:21:** Ms. Deng is back on her knees. A large text overlay appears, covering most of the screen, displaying a social media post.\n\n*   **Visible Documents or Evidence:**\n    *   **Baby Photo:** A clear, framed photo of a smiling infant (presumably Luoxi) is held by Ms. Deng throughout the protest.\n    *   **Protest Sign:** A large white sign and a red sign are visible. The red sign (0:09-0:11) has white Chinese characters, but they are mostly obscured during the struggle. The social media screenshot (0:58-1:19) likely contains the text from the sign.\n    *   **Bruise:** A visible dark bruise on Ms. Deng's left leg (0:11-0:19) supports her claim of being physically assaulted.\n\n*   **Social Media Screenshots Visible on Screen:**\n    *   **0:58-1:19:** A screenshot of a social media post (platform looks like Weibo or similar) with the title \"Hot\" and a timestamp \"25-11-17 13:45 发布于 湖南\" (Published in Hunan). The post details the alleged medical malpractice.\n\n*   **Family Grief Moments:**\n    *   Ms. Deng's continuous crying, kneeling, and lying on the ground in distress, clutching her daughter's photo, are powerful expressions of grief. Her desperate pleas and accusations are central to this.\n\n*   **Before/After Photos of Luoxi:**\n    *   Only a single photo of Luoxi (presumably \"before\" her death) is shown. No \"after\" photos or medical records are explicitly displayed.\n\n*   **Symbolic Imagery:**\n    *   The photo of the smiling baby serves as a poignant symbol of the lost life and the mother's grief.\n    *   The act of kneeling is a traditional sign of extreme supplication or protest in Chinese culture.\n\n## 4.

Afterwards, the doctor claimed the surgery was successful and not a medical accident.
