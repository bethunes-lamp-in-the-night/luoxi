## 2. Audio Transcription (Chinese → Text)

**Background Music:** A melancholic, gentle Chinese song plays throughout the video. The lyrics are partially audible and seem to be about longing and remembrance.

-   **[00:04] Female voice:** "妈妈把你接回家了。" (Māmā bǎ nǐ jiē huí jiā le.) - "Mommy brought you home."
-   **[00:10] Female voice:** "妈妈把你接回家了。" (Māmā bǎ nǐ jiē huí jiā le.) - "Mommy brought you home."
-   **[00:16] Female voice:** "妈妈把你从尿里接回来了。" (Māmā bǎ nǐ cóng niào lǐ jiē huí lái le.) - "Mommy brought you back from the urine." (This phrase is unusual and might be a mishearing or a colloquial/personal expression. It could also be "从你那里接回来了" - "brought you back from there," or "从你那儿接回来了" - "brought you back from your place/side," or even "从你那里接回了" - "brought you back from where you were.") *Given the context of a memorial, "从你那里" (from your place/where you are) or "从你那儿" is more likely, implying bringing the spirit or memory home.*
-   **[00:37] Female voice:** "嗯。" (En.) - "Mm." (A soft sound of affirmation or contemplation.)
-   **[00:42] Female voice:** "小洛洛。" (Xiǎo Luòluò.) - "Little Luoluo."
-   **[00:46] Female voice:** "以后我们就在家里。" (Yǐhòu wǒmen jiù zài jiālǐ.) - "From now on, we'll just be at home."
-   **[00:48] Female voice:** "哪里都不去。" (Nǎlǐ dōu bù qù.) - "Won't go anywhere."
-   **[00:53] Female voice:** "再也没有坏人欺负你了。" (Zài yě méiyǒu huàirén qīfù nǐ le.) - "No bad people will bully you anymore."

**Emotional Tone:** The female voice is consistently gentle, soft, and filled with a deep sense of longing, sadness, and protective love. The background music enhances this melancholic and tender atmosphere.

        -   The memorial tablet is partially visible behind the bunny nightlight.
    -   **00:33 - 00:40:** A hand (presumably the same person's) reaches in and gently touches the bunny nightlight, causing its ears to change color from blue to pink/purple.
