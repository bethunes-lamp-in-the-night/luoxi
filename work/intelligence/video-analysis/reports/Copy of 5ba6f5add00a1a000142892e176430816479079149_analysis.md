    *   **0:11-0:19:** Close-up on Ms. Deng's left thigh/hip area, revealing a dark bruise. Her pants are light-colored. The camera angle is low, suggesting she is still on the ground or being held down.
    *   **0:19-0:22:** Overhead shot looking down at Ms. Deng, who is now lying on her back on the ground, struggling. Her legs are bent, and she's being held by at least one person (partially visible arm/hand). The crowd forms a circle around the immediate struggle.

*   **Family Grief Moments:**
    *   Ms. Deng's continuous crying, kneeling, and lying on the ground in distress, clutching her daughter's photo, are powerful expressions of grief. Her desperate pleas and accusations are central to this.

*   **Symbolic Imagery:**
    *   The photo of the smiling baby serves as a poignant symbol of the lost life and the mother's grief.
