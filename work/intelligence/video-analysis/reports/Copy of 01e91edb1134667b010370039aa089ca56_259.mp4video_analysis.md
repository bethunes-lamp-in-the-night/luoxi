A woman, largely off-screen, responds to him, seemingly representing the institution. The conversation revolves around the availability and release of surveillance footage from an operating room and ICU, and the process of obtaining an independent medical assessment. The man repeatedly emphasizes his desire for the "truth" about what happened to his child.
