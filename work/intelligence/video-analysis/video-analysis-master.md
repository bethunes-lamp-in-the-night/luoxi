Four-panel comparison contrasting Luoxi's working-class mother with wealthy influencer Dong Zhuoya. Shows disparity in resources, lifestyle, and access to justice/care.

- IF USED:
  - Focus on: "Ordinary families need same justice as wealthy"

  - Emphasize: Systemic inequality, not individuals
- Consider: Does this advance the case or create tangent?

## CRITICAL BLOCKERS & NEXT STEPS

### BLOCKER SUMMARY:

**What Was Completed:**
✅ All 19 image files analyzed
✅ ~800 Chinese characters extracted from images
✅ Top 20 viral clip candidates identified
✅ Translation priorities ranked
✅ Visual asset catalog created
✅ Production notes for each asset

**What Cannot Be Completed by AI:**
❌ Watch 20 video files (cannot play .mp4/.mov)
❌ Transcribe Chinese audio from videos
❌ Identify precise timestamps within videos
❌ Extract video frames at key emotional moments
❌ Hear family members' voices (tone, emotion)
❌ Document father's timeline narration

**Impact of Blocker:**
- Missing ~2-4 hours of video content
- Unknown Chinese audio transcripts
- Family voices not captured
- Timeline gaps in father's documentation
- Potential viral moments in videos not identified

### RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:

**Option 1: Human Video Analyst (Recommended)**
1. Assign Chinese-speaking analyst to watch all 20 videos
2. Create timestamped Chinese transcripts
3. Note emotional beats with precise timestamps
4. Extract key quotes from family members
5. Identify viral clip segments
6. Provide to Translation Coordinator
**Timeline:** 8-12 hours of work

**Option 2: Automated + Human Hybrid**
1. Use Chinese speech-to-text service (iFlytek, Alibaba Cloud)
2. Human reviews auto-transcripts for accuracy
3. Human identifies emotional moments
4. AI processes corrected transcripts
**Timeline:** 6-8 hours

**Option 3: Proceed with Images Only**
1. Use 19 image assets for immediate content production
2. Defer video analysis to later phase
**Risk:** Missing powerful content in videos

**CEO Decision Required:** Which option to pursue?
