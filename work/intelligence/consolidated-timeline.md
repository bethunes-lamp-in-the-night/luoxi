## KEY UNCERTAINTIES & GAPS

### Timeline Gaps

1. **Exact diagnosis dates:** When was initial ultrasound performed? When did hospital first recommend surgery?

2. **Surgery details:** Precise timeline during 6-hour surgery; when did complications begin?

3. **Second surgery specifics:** What was the unauthorized second procedure? Why was it performed?

4. **Hospital offer details:** When exactly was 10,000 RMB compensation offered? What were exact terms?

5. **Early social media:** When did family first post publicly? What was initial public response?

### Conflicting Information

1. **Autopsy vs hospital diagnosis:**
   - Hospital: 7mm coronary sinus-type ASD requiring surgery
   - Autopsy: No coronary sinus defect found, only 3mm secundum ASD

2. **Surgery success communication:**
   - 4:00 PM: "Not going smoothly," 50% survival
   - 4:30 PM: "Successful, stable vital signs"
   - 10:03 PM: Death

3. **Medical records:**
   - Records state: "All patches removed"
   - Autopsy finds: 1.4 × 0.5 cm patch inside heart

4. **Death toll at hospital:**
   - NTD report: 5 children on operating table + 1 from IV drip
   - Other sources: 1 additional confirmed 5-year-old death
   - **Needs verification:** Full scope of hospital incidents

### Information Needs

1. **Complete surgical timeline:** Minute-by-minute account of 6-hour procedure
2. **Doctor Chen's background:** Previous surgical record, training, any prior incidents
3. **Hospital statistics:** Total surgeries, success rates, previous complaints
4. **Investigation team composition:** Who conducted December investigation? Conflicts of interest?
5. **Medical necessity analysis:** Expert opinions on whether ANY surgery was needed
6. **International standards:** What do global pediatric cardiology guidelines say about 3mm secundum ASD in 5-month-old?
