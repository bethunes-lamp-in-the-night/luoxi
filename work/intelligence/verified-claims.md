- Expected duration: under 3 hours
- **Source:** Sixth Tone article (independent journalism), incident.md

- NO coronary sinus defect found

## TIER 3: ALLEGATIONS (Must Attribute & Qualify)

### False Diagnosis Allegation

**Family's position:**
- Hospital falsely diagnosed coronary sinus-type ASD to justify unnecessary surgery
- **Evidence supporting:** Autopsy found no such defect
- **Hospital position:** Not publicly addressed in detail
- **Investigation finding:** Did not specifically address diagnosis accuracy

**USAGE:** "The family alleges the hospital falsely diagnosed a coronary sinus-type atrial septal defect to justify surgery, pointing to autopsy findings that showed no such defect existed."

### Financial Motivation Allegation

**Speculation:**
- Hospital may have had financial incentive to perform unnecessary surgeries
- **Evidence:** None direct; inferred from pattern
- **Status:** Unproven allegation

**USAGE:** "Some observers have questioned whether financial incentives may have motivated unnecessary procedures, though this remains unproven." OR BETTER: Avoid stating without evidence

### Cover-Up Allegation

**Family's position:**
- Hospital and local authorities engaged in systematic cover-up
- Evidence of falsified records
- Investigation whitewashed findings
- **Supporting evidence:** Deleted hospital statement, censored articles, investigation's limited scope
- **Status:** Partially supported but not fully proven

**USAGE:** "The family alleges a systematic cover-up, citing the hospital's deletion of its public statement, the censorship of critical articles, and what they characterize as a limited investigation that failed to address key questions."

### Investigator Conflict of Interest

**Family/public concern:**
- Local investigators may have financial or institutional ties to hospital
- Health Commission investigates hospitals it oversees
- **Evidence:** Structural relationship exists; specific conflicts not documented
- **Status:** Reasonable concern but specific conflicts not proven

**USAGE:** "The family and some observers have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, noting that the Ningbo Health Commission investigated a hospital it oversees."

### Police Intimidation Claims

**Photo evidence:**
- Image of police officer grabbing/confronting crying mother
- Mother on street with sign saying "Don't hit us"
- **Context:** Photos exist but full circumstances unclear
- **Status:** Visual evidence of confrontation; "intimidation" characterization is interpretation

**USAGE:** "Photos show police confronting the grieving mother during her public advocacy, which the family characterizes as intimidation." OR "A photo captioned 'Don't hit us' shows the mother pleading during a public appearance."

### Multiple Deaths at Hospital

**NTD TV report (Dec 17):**
- Claims 5 children died on operating table
- Another 5-year-old died from IV drip
- **Source:** NTD TV (Source #066)
- **Verification:** One additional case confirmed (5-year-old fever case); full scope not independently verified
- **Status:** Partially verified (2 deaths), full claim unverified

**USAGE:** "Overseas media outlet NTD TV reported multiple deaths at the same hospital, though the full scope of these claims has not been independently verified. At least one additional death of a 5-year-old has been separately reported." OR SAFER: Only mention the confirmed 5-year-old case

---

## TIER 4: SPECULATION (Avoid or Clearly Mark)

### Deliberate Negligence vs Incompetence
- **Question:** Was the malpractice due to incompetence or deliberate negligence?
- **Status:** Cannot be determined from available evidence
- **USAGE:** Avoid speculating; stick to documented facts

### Surgeon's Training/Background Issues
- **Question:** Did surgeon lack proper training or experience?
- **Status:** No information available on Chen Junxian's background
- **USAGE:** Avoid speculating without evidence

### Hospital-Wide Systemic Corruption
- **Theory:** Entire hospital engaged in systematic malpractice for profit
- **Evidence:** Department closure suggests systemic issues; specific corruption not proven
- **USAGE:** Stick to verified facts (department closed, multiple incidents); avoid sweeping corruption claims

### Central Government Response Predictions
- **Question:** Will central government intervene more forcefully?
- **Status:** Provincial work group dispatched; future actions unknown
- **USAGE:** Report what HAS happened; avoid predicting what WILL happen

### Legal Outcome Predictions
- **Question:** Will there be criminal charges? Will family win lawsuit?
- **Status:** Case ongoing; outcome unknown
- **USAGE:** Report current status only; avoid predictions

## CONFLICTING INFORMATION TO ADDRESS

### Hospital Diagnosis vs Autopsy

**Hospital claimed:** 7mm coronary sinus-type ASD
**Autopsy found:** No coronary sinus defect, only 3mm secundum ASD

**How to present:**
"The hospital diagnosed a 7mm coronary sinus-type atrial septal defect before surgery. However, according to autopsy findings published by the family and reported by multiple news outlets, no coronary sinus defect was found—only a 3mm secundum atrial septal defect, a different and milder condition."

### Surgery Success Communications

**4:00 PM:** "Not going smoothly," 50% survival
**4:30 PM:** "Successful, stable vital signs"
**10:03 PM:** Death

**How to present:**
"According to reports, the family was first told around 4:00 PM that the surgery was not going smoothly and their baby had only a 50% chance of survival. Just 30 minutes later, they were told the surgery was successful with stable vital signs. The baby died at 10:03 PM the same day."

### Patch Removal

**Medical records:** "All patches removed"
**Autopsy finding:** 1.4 × 0.5 cm patch found inside heart

**How to present:**
"Medical records state that all surgical patches were removed, but according to autopsy findings, a 1.4 × 0.5 cm pericardial patch was found inside the heart. The family filed a formal legal objection alleging record falsification."

### Investigation Characterization

**Official finding:** "Insufficient risk assessment, surgical errors, delayed communication"
**Family/public view:** Whitewash of false diagnosis, unauthorized surgery, falsified records

**How to present:**
"The official investigation characterized the incident as involving 'insufficient risk assessment, surgical errors, and delayed communication with the family.' However, critics argue this characterization fails to address key questions including the accuracy of the pre-surgical diagnosis, the undisclosed second surgery, and allegations of falsified medical records."

## FACT-CHECKING GUIDELINES FOR CONTENT CREATORS

### Before Publishing, Verify:

**TIER 1 claims:** ✅ Can state as fact
- Cross-referenced with multiple sources
- Supported by official documents
- Photo/video evidence exists

**TIER 2 claims:** ⚠️ Must attribute
- Single credible source
- Use "according to..." / "reported by..." / "the autopsy states..."
- Name the source

**TIER 3 claims:** ⚠️⚠️ Must clearly attribute and qualify
- Use "alleges" / "claims" / "according to the family..."

- Do not present as fact

### Red Flags - Do Not State Without Verification:

❌ "The hospital deliberately gave a false diagnosis for profit" - Financial motive unproven
❌ "Five children died on the operating table" - Only 1-2 deaths independently confirmed
❌ "The investigators were bribed" - Conflict of interest concern, but no proof of bribery
❌ "This is systematic corruption" - Pattern exists but "corruption" requires proof
❌ "The baby would definitely have healed without surgery" - Expert opinion says likely, not certain

### Safe Phrasings:

✅ "The autopsy found no coronary sinus defect, despite the hospital's pre-surgery diagnosis" - Factual
✅ "According to the family, records were falsified" - Attributed
✅ "Questions have been raised about the necessity of the surgery" - Neutral
✅ "The family alleges..." - Clear attribution
✅ "Medical experts note that 3mm defects often heal naturally" - Attributed to expertise
