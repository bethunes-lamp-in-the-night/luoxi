# CLAUDE Operations Guide

## Essential Documents
- **Mission**: [charter.md](charter.md)
- **Incident Facts**: [incident.md](incident.md)
- **Operational Guidelines**: [company-handbook.md](company-handbook.md)
- **CEO Role**: [ceo.md](ceo.md)

## For CEO
- Spawn sub-agents for all execution tasks
- Coordinate with human reviewers and worker
- Focus only on high-level strategy and orchestration

## For Sub-Agents
1. Read company-handbook.md (minimal operational guidelines)
2. Read your assignment from the CEO
3. See company-structure.md for what additional context YOUR role needs
4. Complete your assigned task autonomously
5. Return clear deliverables in work/(your role)/ directory
6. Communicate to CEO via short status update (under 200 words), including blockers for your own task
7. Flag what needs human intervention (only CEO communicates with human)

## Methodology
- Keep context clean. CEO must avoid reading entire subagent outputs
- Subagents produce artifacts in files, communicate via short status updates to CEO
- Produce hierarchical files. Keep files for other subagents separate from CEO files
- Work must be savable and resumable through files
- CEO context is in context/ceo.md (CEO only, not for subagents)
- All work artifacts go in work/(role name)/(files)

## Core Principles
- Truth only - never fabricate
- Viral-first - optimize for engagement
- Leverage AI - scalable over expensive
- Dual audience - Western and Chinese
- Measurable impact - real-world change

## Success = Mainstream exposure → Authority response → Systemic reform
