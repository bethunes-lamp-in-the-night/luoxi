# CEO Context (Session Persistence)

**Date:** 2026-01-11
**For incident facts, see incident.md**

---

## Current Status

**Phase 1:** ✅ COMPLETE (Grade A-)
- 70 sources, 50 files catalogued, 150+ facts verified, 5 viral opportunities identified
- Deliverables: work/intelligence/ (12 files ~300KB)

**Next:** Phase 1.5 (Translation, Video, Archiving) → THEN M2.0 → THEN Phase 2 (Narratives)

---

## Critical Constraints

1. **3-month mission window** - capitalize on momentum before censorship/attention fade
2. **ONE human worker only** - maximize scriptability
3. **No external Chinese expert help** - censorship risk, personal danger
4. **95% content Chinese-only** - translation bottleneck (Phase 1.5 addresses)
5. **NO GUI tools** - only prompt-driven AI (Runway, ElevenLabs, Midjourney, etc.)
6. **Don't boil ocean** - complete all milestones, skip perfection details
7. **Agents flag blockers, don't solve** - CEO coordinates cross-cutting issues

## Phase 1 Key Intelligence

**Evidence:** Ironclad autopsy proof - hospital diagnosed 7mm defect requiring surgery, autopsy found NO such defect (only 3mm, 80% self-heal)
**Viral Assets:** Before/after photos, grandmother feeding empty clothes, 290K Douyin followers
**Top Narrative:** "Surgery That Didn't Need to Happen"
**Window:** 2-4 weeks before censorship escalation
**Western Media:** ZERO coverage (first-mover advantage)

**Gaps Identified:**
- Translation (95% Chinese content) → Phase 1.5 Translation Coordinator
- Videos not watched (21 files) → Phase 1.5 Video Analyst
- Archiving not done (URGENT 24-48hr) → Phase 1.5 Archiving Specialist

## Strategic Learnings

**Inter-phase Communication Fix:**
- Problem: M2 agents would read 12 M1 files (~300KB)
- Solution: Each phase starts with Brief Creator (synthesizes previous phase into 15-20KB)
- Pattern: M2.0 creates media-index-brief.md for M2.1/M2.2/M2.3
- **CRITICAL:** Phase 1.5 must complete FIRST, then M2.0 consolidates, then M2.1/M2.2/M2.3 run

**Agent Scope Clarity:**
- Agents execute task, flag blockers to CEO, stay in scope
- Agents DON'T spawn other agents, solve cross-cutting issues, or be proactive
- CEO coordinates translation, archiving, human-dependent tasks

**Company Structure:**
- 25 agent roles total (added: Translation, Video, Archiving, 2 Brief Creators, Phase Lieutenants)
- Phase Lieutenants do QA → CEO reads reports, not all outputs
- Keeps CEO context clean

## Next Session Re-hydration

**Read on next spawn:**
1. context/ceo.md (this file)
2. work/phase-1-report.md (Phase 1 Lieutenant QA summary)
3. Check work/ceo/strategy.md and company-structure.md for latest plan

**DO NOT read:** work/intelligence/ files (too much context, delegate to lieutenants)

## Human Actions Needed

**URGENT (24-48hr):**
- Execute archiving: Download family Douyin (@小洛熙妈妈, 292K followers)

**Decisions:**
- Approve updated strategy.md and company-structure.md?
- Proceed to Phase 1.5 spawn (Translation, Video, Archiving)?
- After Phase 1.5 completes: spawn M2.0 → then M2.1/M2.2/M2.3
