# CEO Context (Session Persistence)

**Date:** 2026-01-11
**Mission:** Viral social media → Mainstream media → Authority response → Systemic reform

---

## Current Status

**Phase 1:** ✅ COMPLETE (Grade A-)
**Phase 1.5:** ✅ COMPLETE (Translation + Video Analysis + Archiving Scripts)
**Privacy Review Phase 1+1.5:** ✅ COMPLETE (Git history cleaned by human)
**Phase 2:** ✅ COMPLETE (Narrative Architecture - Grade B+)
  - M2.0: Media Index Brief (51KB consolidation)
  - M2.1: Western Framework (8 viral angles, 10-50M reach projection)
  - M2.2: Chinese Framework (7 angles + censorship strategy)
  - M2.3: Authority Framework (5 off-ramps + "Luoxi's Law")
**Privacy Review Phase 2:** ✅ COMPLETE (Clean - zero PII leaks)
**Phase 3:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS (Viral Mechanics & Growth Strategy)
  - M3.1: Viral Mechanics Researcher (platform algorithms)
  - M3.2: Growth Hacking Strategist (influencer collaboration)
  - M3.3: Wikipedia Strategist (notability + article draft)

**Next Action:**
1. Phase 3 agents complete viral mechanics research
2. Privacy Review for Phase 3
3. Then Phase 4: Content Production Infrastructure (M4.0-M4.6)

## Critical Learnings (Session to Session)

### 🚨 SECURITY FAILURE: PII Leaks (2026-01-11) - RESOLVED
- **Issue:** CEO and agents leaked ~77 instances of PII (absolute paths with usernames)
- **Violated:** Charter principle to protect collaborator anonymity from retaliation
- **Root Cause:** No privacy review process, no PII guidelines in handbook
- **Corrected:**
  - Created Privacy Review Agent (mandatory post-phase audits)
  - Added privacy requirements to company-handbook.md
  - Privacy agent creates remediation plans (file fixes + git history rewrite)
- **Protocol:** Privacy Review Agent runs after EVERY phase before proceeding
- **Resolution Status:**
  - Phase 1/1.5: Git history cleaned by human ✅
  - Phase 2: Zero PII leaks detected ✅
  - Privacy protocols working as designed

### Agents Must Be Maximally Scriptable
- **Issue:** Phase 1.5 agents initially created human-heavy workflows (8-20 hours manual labor)
- **Corrected:** AI-driven automation (Gemini 2.5 Flash $0.40 vs original $87)
- **Principle:** "Maximally scriptable" = agent-driven with minimal human setup

### Phase Consolidator Pattern ✅ PROVEN
- **Problem:** M2 agents reading 12 M1 files (~300KB) = context bloat
- **Solution:** M2.0 consolidates all Phase 1+1.5 → single brief (51KB actual)
- **Pattern:** Each phase starts with Brief Creator before execution agents
- **Success:** M2.1/M2.2/M2.3 worked efficiently from consolidated brief
- **Continuation:** M4.0 will consolidate Phase 2+3 for content production agents

### Agent Output Standards (2026-01-11)
- **Problem:** File bloat, redundant summaries (URGENT-CEO-BRIEFING.md + START-HERE.md + README.md)
- **Solution:** Standardized AGENT-REPORT-[name].md format (see company-handbook.md)
- **Pattern:** ONE report per agent, clear file taxonomy (for-humans/, research/)
- **Result:** Reduced redundancy, predictable structure

### Agent Scope Discipline
- Agents execute task → flag blockers → don't solve cross-cutting issues
- CEO coordinates translation, archiving, human-dependent tasks
- Lieutenants QA → CEO reads reports (not all agent outputs)

### Research-Verify Tools
- **yt-dlp for Douyin:** ❌ Broken (2024-2025 GitHub issues)
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash for video:** ✅ 217x cheaper than ffmpeg+Whisper+Claude pipeline
- **Lesson:** Don't assume tools work - research verify first

---

## Key Constraints (Driving Decisions)

1. **3-month mission window** → Skip perfection, complete milestones
2. **ONE human worker** → Everything must be scriptable/automated
3. **NO GUI tools** → Only prompt-driven AI (Runway, Midjourney, etc.)
4. **Translation bottleneck** → Internal AI translation (Phase 1.5 solved)

---

## Phase 3 Strategic Addition (2026-01-14)

**Why added:** CEO identified critical gap - jumping from narrative frameworks to content creation without deep viral mechanics research risked suboptimal performance

**New Phase 3 agents:**
- M3.1: Viral Mechanics Researcher (TikTok/Instagram/YouTube/X algorithms)
- M3.2: Growth Hacking Strategist (influencer collaboration, cross-platform amplification)
- M3.3: Wikipedia Strategist (notability assessment + article draft)

**Impact:** Pushes original Phase 3 → Phase 4, ensures maximum viral potential

**Learning:** Foundation research before execution > rushing to content creation

---

## Next Session Re-hydration

**When CEO spawns next time, read:**
1. This file (context/ceo.md) - current status and learnings
2. work/phase-2-report.md (Phase 2 QA - B+ grade, what's ready)
3. work/viral-mechanics/ (Phase 3 research outputs when complete)
4. Check Phase 3 completion status → proceed to Phase 4 or wait

**Don't read:**
- work/intelligence/ files (consolidated in media-index-brief.md)
- work/narratives/ frameworks (read phase-2-report.md summary instead)

---

## Human Actions Needed

**COMPLETED:**
- ✅ Phase 1.5 execution (translations, video analysis, archiving scripts)
- ✅ Git history cleanup (PII remediation)

**CURRENT (No urgent human tasks):**
- Phase 3 agents researching viral mechanics (AI-driven, no human input needed)
- Archiving scripts ready when human wants to execute

**UPCOMING (After Phase 3):**
- Review Phase 3 deliverables (viral mechanics research, Wikipedia strategy)
- Approve Wikipedia article draft before human submission
- Proceed to Phase 4 content production
