## Critical Decisions (2026-01-24 Session)

### CEO Decision: Option A + Option A

**Decision 1: Wikipedia Strategy - Submit NOW (not wait for Western media)**
- Research found 7 NEW Wikipedia-valid sources (Mothership.sg, Global Times 3x, etc.)
- Total 81+ sources (10 English, 68 Chinese, 3 petitions)
- Submit Chinese Wikipedia FIRST (85-90% acceptance, 2-3 weeks)
- Submit English Wikipedia 1-2 weeks later (60-70% acceptance)
- Don't wait for NYT/BBC/CNN (may never cover)

**Decision 2: Mission Scope - Revised Realistic Targets**
- Accept 500K-1M reach (not 10M)
- Accept 1-2 regional journalist articles (not 5-10 NYT/BBC)
- Accept Month 2-3 Wikipedia (not Week 4)
- Success probability: 40-60% (honest assessment)

### CEO Decision: Build All Originally Planned Media Types

Despite 1 human + $200 constraints, CEO wants content for:
- TikTok (Week 1 priority)
- YouTube Shorts (Week 2-4 if TikTok succeeds)
- Instagram Reels (Week 2-4 if TikTok succeeds)
- X/Twitter threads (Week 2-4 if TikTok succeeds)

Phase 4 agents will optimize for multi-platform but acknowledge execution constraint.

### CEO Decision: File Structure Cleanup DEFERRED

- File structure audit found 13 violations of company-handbook.md
- Cleanup script ready (4-5 hours to execute)
- CEO: "don't make any changes"
- **Decision: Defer cleanup to Week 2-3 or after Phase 4**

### CEO Constraint: $200 Budget

- Spend $0 Week 1-4 (100% organic)
- Reserve $200 for Month 2-3 proven winners only
- TikTok algorithm is meritocratic (great content = free reach)
- Paid ads require proven winner to amplify

---

## Critical Learnings (Session to Session)

### 🚨 SECURITY: PII Leaks - RESOLVED & PROTOCOLS WORKING
- **Phase 1/1.5:** 77 leaks → Git history cleaned by human ✅
- **Phase 2:** 0 leaks ✅
- **Phase 3:** 1 leak → fixed immediately ✅
- **Post-production:** 0 leaks ✅
- **Privacy protocols:** Mandatory post-phase reviews working effectively
- **Wikipedia files:** Approved for immediate public posting

### Feasibility Reality Check (2026-01-24)

**Problem discovered:** Phase 3 original plans required 138-205 hours Week 1 (impossible for 1 human with 40 hours/week)

**Solution:** Complete revision cycle
- M3.1: Focus TikTok only Week 1, 3 videos max (not 12-20 across platforms)
- M3.2: 10 actions only (journalist outreach + Reddit + basic tracking)
- Week 1 total: 15-27 hours (achievable)

**Pattern learned:** Always validate time estimates against human constraints before proceeding to next phase

### Wikipedia Article Readability (2026-01-24)

**Problem:** v2 article was "dry, blabbering of dates and times" - CEO feedback

**Solution:** Complete rewrite studying real Wikipedia articles
- Lead hooks with WHY (99.5% promise → death → autopsy contradicted)
- Human story first (not bureaucratic timeline)
- Emphasizes ongoing nature throughout (not "resolved")
- Comparable to Charlie Gard, Alfie Evans articles
- Serves mission (shareable, attracts journalists, pressures authorities)

**Learning:** Wikipedia needs to be READABLE and serve the mission, not just meet notability standards

### Dual-Language Wikipedia Strategy (2026-01-24)

**Discovery:** English and Chinese Wikipedia are NOT translations
- Different conventions, tone, source standards
- Chinese Wikipedia: 68 Chinese sources, higher acceptance (85-90%)
- English Wikipedia: 10 English sources, lower acceptance (60-70%)

**Strategy:** Submit Chinese FIRST (higher success, faster timeline), then English

**Learning:** Research platform conventions before creating content

### Phase Consolidator Pattern ✅ PROVEN AGAIN

- M2.0: Consolidated Phase 1+1.5 (300KB → 51KB)
- M4.0: Consolidated Phase 2+3 (464KB → 67KB)
- Pattern works: 86% reduction, clean context handoff
- **Continue for all future phases**

### Agent Output Standards - Violations Identified (2026-01-24)

**File structure audit found:**
- 13 violations of company-handbook.md
- Version-labeled files (v2, v3, FINAL) prohibited
- Navigation files (EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY, README) prohibited
- Missing for-humans/ and research/ directories

**Pattern recognized:** Agents don't naturally follow handbook taxonomy when producing multiple versions

**Solution options:**
1. Cleanup now (4-5 hours)
2. Defer to Week 2-3
3. Update handbook to allow exceptions

**Decision:** Deferred (not mission-critical now)

### Research-Verify Tools
- **yt-dlp for Douyin:** ❌ Broken (2024-2025 GitHub issues)
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash for video:** ✅ 217x cheaper than ffmpeg+Whisper+Claude pipeline
- **Wikipedia source research:** Found 7 new sources by aggressive web searching
- **Lesson:** Always research-verify, don't assume tools work or sources are fully catalogued

---

## Key Constraints (Driving Decisions)

1. **3-month mission window** → Skip perfection, complete milestones, focus on Week 1 execution
2. **ONE human worker** → Everything must be maximally scriptable/automated, 40 hours/week max
3. **$200 total budget** → Spend $0 Week 1-4 (organic only), save for proven winners Month 2-3
4. **NO GUI tools** → Only prompt-driven AI (CapCut, Canva Free, Google Docs - all free)
5. **Zero influencer contacts** → Journalist-first strategy (10-15% response vs 2-5% influencers)

---

- [ ] Submit Chinese Wikipedia (follow submission-checklist-chinese.txt)
- [ ] Monitor TikTok analytics (check for viral potential)

**WEEK 2-4:**
- [ ] Follow up with journalists Day 7, Day 14

- [ ] Submit English Wikipedia (after Chinese accepted or Week 3)

**MONTH 2-3:**
- [ ] Update Wikipedia with investigation progress
- [ ] If journalist article published → spend $50-100 to promote
- [ ] If TikTok video hits 100K+ → spend $100 to boost

**OPTIONAL (Deferred):**
- [ ] File structure cleanup (work/CLEANUP-SCRIPT.sh, 4-5 hours)
- [ ] Handbook update (add file size guidelines)

---

## Success Metrics (Realistic)

**Week 1 Minimum Success:**
- 20K-50K TikTok views OR
- 1 journalist response OR
- 500+ Reddit upvotes
- **Any ONE = success, continue to Week 2**

**Month 1 Target:**
- 100K-300K total reach
- 1 journalist article published (regional/niche outlet)
- Chinese Wikipedia live
- 1K+ engaged followers

**Month 3 Mission Success:**
- 500K-1M total reach
- 1-2 journalist articles published
- Dual-language Wikipedia live
- 5K+ engaged followers
- Family's story permanently documented
- Investigation ongoing, authorities under pressure

**Success probability: 40-60%** (honest assessment, not guaranteed)

---

## Phase 4 Readiness

**M4.0 Production Brief:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Week 1 scripts:** ✅ READY (copy-paste, zero creative decisions)
**Journalist targets:** ✅ READY (10 contacts, email templates)
**Wikipedia submissions:** ✅ READY (Chinese first, English after)
**Success metrics:** ✅ DEFINED (50K-150K Week 1)

**Can proceed to:**
- Phase 4 content production agents (M4.1-M4.6) for multi-platform optimization
- OR direct Week 1 execution using existing minimum viable materials

**Recommendation:** Execute Week 1 minimum viable FIRST, then spawn Phase 4 agents for Week 2-4 based on results.
