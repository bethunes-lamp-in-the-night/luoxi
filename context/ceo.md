# CEO Context (Session Persistence)

**This file is for CEO context across sessions. For incident facts, see incident.md**

## Current Session State

**Date Started:** 2026-01-11

**Strategic Planning Complete:**
- ✅ Strategy documented in work/ceo/strategy.md
- ✅ Company structure defined in work/ceo/company-structure.md
- ✅ 16 subagents created in .claude/agents/
- ✅ Company handbook created

**Next Steps:**
Phase 1 execution - Spawn subagents for intelligence gathering

## Notes from Initial Planning Session

**Key constraints emphasized by human:**
1. Human labor extremely limited - all content must be scriptable via prompts
2. NO GUI tools (Adobe, Photoshop, etc.) - only prompt-driven AI tools
3. Subagent outputs in work/ directory, never edit sources/ or media/
4. Research should prefer Chinese language sources (content sparse in English)
5. Exclude official government sources (sanitized/whitewashed)
6. Phase 1-2 happen TODAY (not weeks), we control the timeline via subagents
7. Mission is iterative/ongoing, not once-and-done
8. Context management critical - keep CEO context minimal, use hierarchical files

**Important corrections made:**
- Investigation is whitewash, not good faith (likely conflicts of interest)
- 10,000 RMB compensation offer was insulting
- Events remain unresolved (not "investigation concluded")
- M1.4 added: Consolidate timeline and facts for other subagents
- M2.0 added: Compile viral ammunition facts first
- Phase 3 clarified: Research scriptable AI tools, create complete prompt libraries
