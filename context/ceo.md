# CEO Context (Session Persistence)

**This file is for CEO context across sessions. For incident facts, see incident.md**

## Current Session State

**Date Started:** 2026-01-11

**Strategic Planning Complete:**
- ✅ Strategy documented in work/ceo/strategy.md
- ✅ Company structure defined in work/ceo/company-structure.md
- ✅ 16 subagents created in .claude/agents/
- ✅ Company handbook created

**Next Steps:**
Phase 1 execution - Spawn subagents for intelligence gathering

## Notes from Initial Planning Session

**Key constraints emphasized by human:**
1. Human labor extremely limited - all content must be scriptable via prompts
2. NO GUI tools (Adobe, Photoshop, etc.) - only prompt-driven AI tools
3. Subagent outputs in work/ directory, never edit sources/ or media/
4. Research should prefer Chinese language sources (content sparse in English)
5. Exclude official government sources (sanitized/whitewashed)
6. Phase 1-2 happen TODAY (not weeks), we control the timeline via subagents
7. Mission is iterative/ongoing, not once-and-done
8. Context management critical - keep CEO context minimal, use hierarchical files

**Important corrections made:**
- Investigation is whitewash, not good faith (likely conflicts of interest)
- 10,000 RMB compensation offer was insulting
- Events remain unresolved (not "investigation concluded")
- M1.4 added: Consolidate timeline and facts for other subagents
- M2.0 added: Compile viral ammunition facts first
- Phase 3 clarified: Research scriptable AI tools, create complete prompt libraries

## Session Progress Tracking

**Planning Complete:**
- Web research on incident
- Strategic plan with 7 phases
- 16 specialized subagent roles defined
- All agent instruction files with YAML frontmatter
- Company handbook, incident facts, company structure

**Phase 1 - COMPLETE ✅**

✅ **M1.1 - Chinese Internet Research**
- 70 sources catalogued, 75% completeness
- Deliverables: work/intelligence/sources/

✅ **M1.2 - Media Parser**
- 50 files catalogued (21 videos, 19 images, 10 documents)
- Deliverables: media-inventory.md, high-priority-assets.md, content-gaps.md

✅ **M1.3 - Narrative Analyst**
- 7 narrative streams mapped, 5 opportunities identified
- Deliverables: narrative-landscape.md, narrative-opportunities.md, competitive-analysis.md

✅ **M1.4 - Timeline Consolidator**
- Complete chronological timeline created
- Deliverables: consolidated-timeline.md, key-facts.md, verified-claims.md, narrative-materials.md

**Key Findings:**
- Viral potential: VERY HIGH (autopsy proof + celebrity support + visual content)
- Top opportunity: "Surgery That Didn't Need to Happen" narrative
- Critical gap: ZERO mainstream Western media coverage (ready for breakthrough)
- Competitive edge: Superior evidence vs. comparable cases

**Critical Human Actions Needed:**
1. URGENT: Archive family Douyin (@小洛熙妈妈, 292K followers) before potential deletion
2. Translation resources for Western media push
3. Medical expert validation (pediatric cardiac surgeon)

**Ready for Phase 2:** All intelligence consolidated. DO NOT proceed to Phase 2 without human approval.
