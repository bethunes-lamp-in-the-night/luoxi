# Luoxi Incident - Facts

**For all company members who need incident context**

---

## Overview
On November 14, 2025, 5-month-old Xu Luoxi died following heart surgery at Ningbo University Affiliated Women and Children's Hospital in Zhejiang Province, China.

## What the Hospital Claimed

**Pre-Surgery:**
- Surgeon Chen told family the procedure had a "success rate of about 99.5%" ([Sixth Tone](https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1017970/china-probe-faults-hospital-in-baby's-death-after-heart-surgery))
- Expected duration: under 3 hours
- Diagnosed condition: ~7mm coronary sinus-type atrial septal defect requiring surgery

**During Surgery:**
- ~4:00 PM: Family informed surgery "had not gone smoothly" with only "50%" survival chances
- ~4:30 PM: Surgeon reports surgery successful with stable vital signs
- ~10:00 PM: Child declared clinically dead
- Actual duration: ~7 hours
- Medical records stated "all patches were removed"

## What Actually Happened

**Surgical Conduct:**
- A second surgical procedure was performed but **never disclosed to the family** ([Sixth Tone](https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1017970/china-probe-faults-hospital-in-baby's-death-after-heart-surgery))
- Family received conflicting information within 30 minutes about their child's condition

**Autopsy Findings (December 19, 2025):**
- **No coronary sinus defect found** - the condition hospital claimed required surgery did not exist ([Vision Times](https://www.visiontimes.com/2025/12/21/chinese-infant-heart-surgery-scandal.html))
- Only a **3mm secundum atrial septal defect** - a mild condition that "typically resolves on its own without surgery" with "more than 80% healing naturally within a year" ([Vision Times](https://www.visiontimes.com/2025/12/21/chinese-infant-heart-surgery-scandal.html))
- **1.4 × 0.5 cm pericardial patch left inside the heart** despite records claiming all patches removed ([Vision Times](https://www.visiontimes.com/2025/12/21/chinese-infant-heart-surgery-scandal.html))
- Father stated these records were "openly falsified" ([Vision Times](https://www.visiontimes.com/2025/12/21/chinese-infant-heart-surgery-scandal.html))

## Official Investigation Response

**December 15, 2025 - Ningbo Health Commission findings:**
- **Whitewashed as:** "insufficient risk assessment, surgical errors, and delayed communication with the family regarding intraoperative emergencies" ([Sixth Tone](https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1017970/china-probe-faults-hospital-in-baby's-death-after-heart-surgery))
- **What this means:** Investigation framed severe ethical breaches (false diagnosis, unauthorized surgery, falsified records) as mere "record-keeping mistakes" and "communication failures"
- **Likely conflicts of interest:** Investigators likely have financial or institutional stakes in the hospital itself
- Did not disclose specific medical errors causing death
- Did not address falsified records or unnecessary surgery based on false diagnosis

**Disciplinary actions:**
- Chief surgeon, anesthesiologist, pediatric ICU attending physician: suspended
- Hospital vice president: removed
- Hospital president and Party secretary: demerit and warning

**What investigation did NOT address:**
- False diagnosis of coronary sinus defect
- Whether surgery was medically unnecessary
- Falsified surgical records
- Criminal liability for performing surgery without proper consent

## Hospital Response to Family

**Compensation Offer:**
Hospital offered 10,000 RMB (~$1,400 USD) refund to parents - an insulting amount given the death of their child and the severity of the malpractice.

**Family Response:**
"We are not seeking compensation. We only want the truth." - Luoxi's father

Family rejected all compensation proposals and filed medical malpractice lawsuit, which was accepted by Ningbo court.

## Current Status: UNRESOLVED

- Medical malpractice lawsuit ongoing
- No acknowledgment that surgery may have been unnecessary
- No criminal investigation despite falsified records
- Heavy online censorship of grassroots support
- Case remains symbol of medical system distrust in China

## Why External Pressure Is Needed

Local and provincial authorities have shown:
1. Unwillingness to acknowledge false diagnosis
2. Characterizing falsified records as mere "communication failures"
3. Administrative discipline instead of criminal investigation
4. No systemic reform or transparency measures
5. Continued censorship of public discussion

This is not just medical malpractice - it's institutional failure demanding external visibility and pressure.

## Key Points

**What makes this criminal, not just malpractice:**
1. False diagnosis to justify unnecessary surgery
2. Second surgery performed without parental consent or knowledge
3. Surgical errors: patch left inside heart, incisions not properly sutured
4. Falsified medical records to cover up errors
5. Investigation whitewashed as "communication failures" (likely conflicts of interest)
6. Insulting 10,000 RMB compensation offer

**The cover-up is as egregious as the original malpractice.**
